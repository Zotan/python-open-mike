## Exercises ([contributed solutions](https://github.com/danielk333/python-open-mike/tree/gh-pages/solutions/1))


## Agenda
General discussion about the format, duration, frequency, and topics for the meet-up series. 


## Problems
Below is few small problems that people can prepare solutions to, either bring them to the event or send them to *daniel.kastinen@irf.se*.
1. Write a function that reverses the order of a list
2. Write a function to reverse the order of words in a string
3. Write a function to combine 2 dictionaries, if there are duplicate keys, the two values should end up in a list under that key or concatenate


## Meeting notes

# The format:
 * Exercises should probably not be the header
 * Real life problems are good
 * It can be too time consuming to solve problems every time, instead: at the of every event we should pick the suggestion for the next one or its picked from a pile of problems. Then it should be the person who suggested the problem that picks the format for next time: either present a solution or have a small workshop on the problem. It is dependent on the  People who read the problem outline can still contribute solutions but its highly optional. 
 * Clean up formulation on the first page
 * Projector should be editor and terminal: i.e. live hacking event and demo
 * Then anyone who has a solution can quickly show and demo or even write a solution live
 * Git and other software development tools can be included, not just Python
 * This is for ANY LEVEL of python programmer
 * Rather than abstract problems, we should really present recipes for real life problems
 * There can be good discussions of conceptual differences between languages
 * One idea?: Each sessions can have 2 parts - One presentation of a recipe for a real life problem, one small walk-trough of beginner problems.
 * Lets make the git page into a really really good cookbook! 

# Duration
 * As needed
 * Probably good max 1 hour

# Frequency
 * Every 4 weeks seems like a good number to keep people coming

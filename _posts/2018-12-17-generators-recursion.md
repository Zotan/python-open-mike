## Exercises

1. Study what the `enumerate` function does and write your own `my_enumerate` that has the same effect.
2. Write a function `my_clock` which starts at midnight, moves the time by one hour and returns the time in 12-hour format,
   e.g. `11 am` or `3 pm` and we can call it and advance by one hour infinitely many times.
3. Write a function which returns the next element of this infinite series: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, ...
4. Write a function which draws or prints a snowflake or x-mas tree in text or ASCII art or somehow - use your creativity! Extra points for using recursion.
   More extra points if the size can be given via argument.

# Agenda

Reading CSV files and merging data.


# Problems

There are two CSV files in [the data folder](https://github.com/danielk333/python-open-mike/tree/gh-pages/data) which contains taxation
percentages by region and year.

The task is to read the data in and merge it, so it could be written out
again in some other form or analysed.

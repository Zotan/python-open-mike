# Format

Eventually it could be a platform where participants show something useful to
others and have creative discussions about programing. But to warm up and get 
into the mood of hacking each event will have a theme and we will suggest 
exercises. Participants can prepare these exercises but do not have to. 
We go through the exercise and solutions together but those who have solved 
the exercises can present alternative solutions which we discuss together.

At each event we fix the dates for the next event and together we choose a
theme.


# What to expect

- Informal events.
- Interaction.
- Questions, answers, and discussions.

The goal is to discuss, ask questions, and to demo.

# What not to expect

Do not expect a semester-long course or lecture series where you can sit back
and somebody presents some slides. There are no slides, and there is no
lecture.


## Exercises

You can email solutions to Daniel Kastinen (daniel.kastinen@irf.se) who will
collect them and make them available (without names) so that you can
compare. It is OK to prepare all or prepare none.


## Next event


<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.status != 'past' %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }} ({{ post.time }}, room: {{ post.room }})</a>
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>


## Past events

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.status == 'past' %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ post.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

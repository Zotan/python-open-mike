I was six at the time. my family on a bus coming from memphis ark. to ft.smith ark. sister and I was in back of bus on the long seat so we could sleep. bus driver stopped bus to use the woods. he jump back in bus and said hold on every body there is a big ape out there that almost got me. as the bus started to move my sister and I looked out the back window and saw what I beleive to be big foot crossing the road. at the time I didnt know about big foot so we thought it was a ape that had excape from a carnival. it looked like an ape that we had seen in a carnival once. it took long strides crossing the road and was not leaning over on its hands to walk. it was more like a real big man in a ape costume. the picture til this day is still fresh in my mind. and it wasnt an ape that I have ever seen in zoo,s or carnivals

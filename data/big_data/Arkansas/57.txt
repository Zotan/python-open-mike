I was duck hunting on the White River in Arkansas from a blind. I saw a large hairy apelike creature across the river flipping over stones and walking oddly. About 100 yards away at the closest. I am a former MARINE, I have hunted in Arkansas for 25 years, and I have never seen anything like that before.

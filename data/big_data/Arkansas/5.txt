Hi BFRO my sighting happen nine months ago near Searcy Arkansas I was hunting on Thanksgiving day. It was getting dark when I had a rock thrown over my head which freaked me out so I quickly turned around and lifted my shotgun and light and look up and down the tree line until I came up on a big oak and I saw what looked like a Sasquatch looking at me from behind the oak and it yelled at me with a low grunt and high pitch scream so I jumped and actually took a shot and hit the tree and it took off running back down the line towards a valley.

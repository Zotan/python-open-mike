A tall (7-8 feet) furry creature was observed walking (on two legs) across the highway, at the outer limits of the high beams on my car. As we passed the spot where the creature crossed the road, we saw saw a 7-8 foot creature with semi-shiny, reddish brown fur standing at the side of the road; it was semi-concealed by some branches.

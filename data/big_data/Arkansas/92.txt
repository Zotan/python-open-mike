I had been visiting a friend one night. It had gotten late and I had to work in the morning, so I got in my car to leave. On my way back to the main road, I stopped at a stop sign. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving in the trees. I looked over and an upright figure came out of the woods towards my car. I would estimate it was 7' to 7'5" tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face. I drove away, quickly, because it was coming towards my door. As I drove, in the rear view mirror I saw it cross the road in about 2 steps, then I lost sight of it.

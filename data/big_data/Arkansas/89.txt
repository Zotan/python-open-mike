While driving to check on my dogs that were being kept at my aunts house in a fenced in area with a ten by ten out building. An adolescent bigfoot ran out of the woods and into my aunts yard it ran between the house and the garage. It was approximately three and a half to four foot tall. I pulled in to the drive but was to afraid to get out of the car had the feeling that something was watching me from the woods. The dogs were yapping but ok so I left because I was afraid.

the summer of 1998 i was driving between heavner oklahome and mena, arkansas ..approximately  2 am ..i popped over a hill and a tall lanky hairy figure..apporximately 7 to 9 ft.ran across the highway in front of my vehicle..it was very clear in my headlights..very long arms and legs..slender with long hair on upper and lower parts of its body..i am absolutely sure it was not a bear and it was too tall and fast to be a human...

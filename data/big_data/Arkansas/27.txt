I was going home from work. I work nights at a plastics company and went up to the lake that night going home that way. I seen something that looked like a big goat at first. Then I got closer and it stood up in the middle of the road. It was white and taller than the car. I did not see it after I went by, it was gone. This happened at about 3:00 am. It was weird to me. I've never seen it again but would like to find it. It makes me very curious.

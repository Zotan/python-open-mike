A family member was driving west around four am in the morning, when the creature crossed the road in front of the car. She is not inclined to repeat the old stories she has heard all her life and has never thought it was real. Well today she has a new respect for those stories, she has said that she was driving on County Road 10 in Miller County, Arkansas going west about a mile or so from Hwy. 237 in Fouke, AR, when it crossed the road right in front of her car.

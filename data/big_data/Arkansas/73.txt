I saw a very tall creature in one of our pastures. It had a medium brown fur coat, but its face was not furry. It made a very loud noise which my neighbors also heard and called our house right after it happened. Thay didn't see the "beast" though. The creature stood about 7.5 ft. tall and was very stoutish.

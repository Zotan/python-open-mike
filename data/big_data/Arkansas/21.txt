The year was 1964, this was in Lee County Arkansas,  we lived on 164 acre farm at the time .I was 11 years old, I was playing outside in the front yard about 2 in the afternoon, I looked up and seen something walking up the road ,It was very tall and had long wavy hair, and it was going from side too side looking in the ditches as if it was searching for something, I screamed for my mom too come and look, She and my older sister came out, They jumped in the car too drive and get a closer look, but it ran into the woods. at that time there was several more sightings in the area. The next Day my older brother came over and we found Large footsteps in the road.

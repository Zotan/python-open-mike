My name is  T.W. and I live in Arkansas. Before this happened I have never had any thing ever happen to me. This happened in September 2017 at about 11 pm. I am a night owl in the summer because its too hot during the day to do a lot. I had just came from inside my house and walked down steps, my truck was parked to my right and I was going to storage room. As I turned a little to go around the front of my truck something caught my side vision that made me turn my head. As I was turning my head this big human like figure was sprinting so fast It was like 2 seconds and it was gone. It had a dark undercoat and light colored on top hair. I have never in my life seen anything run so fast and what got me was it did not make a sound running past me. It was about 25 to 30 ft away in open area. If I had not caught the glimpse of it I would have never even known he went by me. I can see why they can be around and even around a person and not even know.

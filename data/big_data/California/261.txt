I wanted to comment on your report case #8595. My parents live in Sly Park. They are at the edge of the National forest. I have heard sounds late at night along with my brother who lives there. Last summer was the last time. But more importantly I have some photo's that I would like you to see. I have heard that Bigfoot often times will mark their territory or paths that they travel on.

When I was 15 yrs. old I and a friend were outside of Coulterville Ca. It was at night on a ranch.  We were in bed looking out a window from a dark room. The window was six feet off the ground.There was a full moon outside. A Sasquach looked in the window and was looking around the room.  We watched it for about 10 minutes.He'd look around the room and then look around outside and look inside again. My friend told me to go outside and look around. When I looked around I could see nothing.The Sasquach had a head larger than a basketball. It stood about 7 1/2 ft tall.  I must have weighed about 400-500lbs.The head looked like an apes head and the eyes were about the size of tennisballs.  Lots of coarse hair.  The hair was dark brown.

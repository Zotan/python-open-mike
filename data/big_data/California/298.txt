I accidently wrote my experience down in the space that was supposed to be used to describe weather conditions. It was late afternoon, clear skies and good visibility although the tree canopy blocks out a good deal of sunlight from the forest floor.Look in the weather/time of day section for my report (sorry) I don't type very well and haven't the time to re-do everything.

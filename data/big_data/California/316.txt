I was reconing the area just southwest from Louse Camp near bluff creek this weekend on 6-21-03 I came across a single footprint in an old mud puddle the fotprint was 16 inches long and almost 6 inches across at the heel I didnt have any plaster with me but I did have my video camera and I shot some very good video footage of the footprint this was about 3/4 of a mile down stream from louse camp in the six rivers national forest about 24 miles out of orleans.

About 1988, my girlfriend and I were tent camping on Palomar Mountain with another couple. After the first night they left and we decided to spend one more night. Into the late afternoon I had the feeling we were being watched which persisted until we decided to turn in. After settling down into our tent, and being quiet for about 1/2 hour. I heard fast footsteps run through our camp. They were very heavy footfalls like from a heavy man and sounded like someone running flat-footed in boots. I thought maybe it was a man, but why is a man running through my camp on a dark, moonless night? My girlfriend was asleep so she didn't hear. I was still awake as I felt uneasy. Since "it" kept running, I decided not to venture outside to take a look. Nothing else occurred that night and I went to sleep soon after. The next morning there were no footprints or other evidence.

Well me and my friend were hiking through the sierra nevadas until we heard a walking through the brush. I wasnt sure what it was but when i looked to my left i saw this big hairy creature it smelled as a garbage can. It had yellow eyes and was walking away. I tried to get a picture but it was moving in and out of trees. Later on in the night we heard a moving noise outside. my friend said it was a deer but i think it was the creature.

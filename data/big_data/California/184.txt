I was in a creeky wooded area outside of Dunsmuir, CA.  I was sitting high on a side of a large hill.  I noticed a bigfoot squatting down in the creek bed catching fish.  He/She was about 7 1/2 foot tall and very dark colored long hair.  From the distance I was at I couldn't see its face.  The area was dead silent... I moved to get my binoculars and it senced me and took off down the creek bed.

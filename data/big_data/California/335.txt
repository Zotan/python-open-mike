While deer hunting my father in law and I had become lost while following a game trail we took a short cut from one hill to the next and had crossed a ravine at the bottom as we crossed the ravine we found another game trail as we followed this trail I noticed large 14 to 15 inch human type foot prints impressed deeply into the trail these track led down a hill until the terrain became to difficult to follow.

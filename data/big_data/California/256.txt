It was a clear night. There was a full moon and it was about 10:00. We were camping out in Sugar Pine State Park. All of the sudden, there was a loud whooping noise. It sounded close by. Then, we heard a loud crunching, like branches breaking. It couldn't have been a bear, it was too big. In the morning, we saw some footprints by our tent that were about 12-16 inches long. They were much too big to be a bear's. We still dont know what it was, but we are about 90% sure it was Bigfoot.

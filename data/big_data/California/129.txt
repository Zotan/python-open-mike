Hi, I'm K.L.P., and My Mother is S.K.P. and we heard that yell, from what we believe to be a Sasquatch, near our Home here in the Erwin Lake area of Big Bear City, California, at approximately around 2:30 am to around 3:00 am, on the morning' of August 3rd. 2009, I know what I heard, it had all the dog's and cat's in the neighborhood going' crazy, we heard it 3 times within' a half-hour time span, it scared me enough to get up and check outside, I saw several Coyotes run towards our house, like they were scared. and the raccoons that were in our yard were running' around like chicken's with their heads cut off so to speak, we would like to talk to someone about what we heard, My Mother and I will never forget that sound.

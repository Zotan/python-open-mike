Hi, my Name is [L. D.] I am 56 Years old and live in Redding California. Last Saturday evening on January 7, 2006, my wife and I drove from Redding to Shingletown about 26 miles east of Redding to see a puppy that we wanted to buy. It was a very dark night with fog like clouds low to the ground, so I had to pay very close attention to the road.  About 6 miles past Shingletown there is a stretch of road that is straight. About 300 feet up the road from the car, I saw this thing walking across the road.  It looked very tall with big long arms. It had a very large walking stride. It walked like it knew a car was coming, because it went up the side embankment of about 12 to 15 feet. I am just a normal man and I know what I saw.  This is not to far from Lassen Park.

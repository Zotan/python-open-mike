We were driving up (withheld) road to pick our son at a friends house when the creature passed in front of our vehicle, approx. 15-20 feet in front of us. It was clearly illuminated by our head lights. It appeared 7 to 8 feet tall w/ thick brown/black hair. It had two long legs and only took two strides to cross the street.  Then, about 30 minutes later on our way back, we saw it again, this time our son was with us.

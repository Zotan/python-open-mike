BFRO Investigator Charles Lamica transcribed the following initial report from a voice mail left on the BFRO phone system.  Confidential information such as last name and phone number have been edited out... "Hi, my name is Ron ------, and I'm calling from San Diego California. I'm a middle school math teacher or math and special education teacher. I was recently over the three-day weekend up in the eastern Sierras hiking at about twelve thousand feet, and something happened that I can't explain and I just thought I would call you guys and tell you about it if you're interested. I really can't explain it. It was bizarre. But anyway, (phone number). Thank you very much. Bye.

3 of us went out to the woods to get away. We arrived at this loation about 3:00am.  About 30 minutes later we heard a rustling in the bushes. We passed it off as a harmless critter. A couple seconds later we heard a blood curdiling bellow-scream-screech, and we flipped our lids. As we began to run to the car, something that resembles what most people call bigfoot took off into the woods.

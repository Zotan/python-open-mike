Was going back to close shop at approx. 10PM in the northern desert above Palm Springs, CA., and saw a huge light tan colored biped with soft blowing hair .Because I was in a small VW bug with the light pointing down into the street upon leaving the driveway facing out into the desert. I froze there with my dim headlight on it and it too froze there completely still,. I flashed my worthless high beams at it and it took 2 giant steps backwards and then one to my left, it's right and was gone into the dark. I was overcome with severe fear, panic and anxiety, and had to return home again. I was armed with a .45 at the time and was still worried that if I shot it I would be in real trouble. Enormous, with the chest the size of a refrigerator. arms that hung below the knees and were still huge. I did not speak with anyone about it right away because who ever heard of a desert Bigfoot, But later found out that all the locals call him, "Yucca Man".

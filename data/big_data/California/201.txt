I was traveling to the coast toward Petaluma just past Sonoma area either Hwy 116 or 12, I don't remember, around nine years ago and around 11 pm when out jumped somthing on the road.  There was a car coming toward us so this thing huge in stature turned both directions allowing us to see it was on two legs, then it leaned forward with a bolt of speed.  It jumped a fence up hill in a full run with out the use of its arms and was gone quick so quick, I knew it was not a person

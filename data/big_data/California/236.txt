On 06-13-98 I heard a sound like the one on your web site titled scream wave, this started around 10 pm and lasted at least until 2am. On 06-14-98 I heard this same sount in the afternoon and again at night (unknown times), this was also witnessed by 2 friends of mine that were spending the night. On 06-15-98, again around 10 pm this noise was heard again at about 10pm. On 06-16-98 I again heard this scream at 7:45 pm and it lasted for about 5 min. and last night at about 2am again this was heard. All sounds seemed as though they were coming form the ridge west of my residence. They were loud but from a distance, and continued from a min of 20 sec. to a max of 5 min.

I observed a "whatever you choose to call it" about one hundred yards away. It was a light to medium-brown color and I would guess it must have been about 8 feet tall. It was walking away from me at a fast pace and looking back at me over it's left shoulder. It had long arms that were swinging more than the average man's would.

It was about 1:00 a.m. and I heard the most scariest howl that echoed through the mountains. I have been backpacking in the mountains in northern California 4 times a year for the past 10 years and have never heard anything like it. Bigfoot was the first thing that crossed my mind, as to what it might have been.

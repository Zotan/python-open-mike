I didn't get out of my car. I didn't have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides), then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy, a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun.

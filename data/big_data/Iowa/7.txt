My Brother in law and I were hunting geese in a harvested Soy Bean field east of Carlisle Iowa about a mile out of town, we were concealed in our blind along a fence line, we saw a movement to the east of us and what we saw was just like many pictures that we had seen. The creature?? Had to be maybe six and a half to seven and a half foot tall (guessing) and was bent over, was black and walking faster than we had ever seen a human walk. We.left our blind and walked over to where we saw it but the ground was frozen so there were no tracks in the ground. The area was vacated in the 1960s as part of the Red Rock Lake project by the Corps of Engineers. We agreed to not say anything because we didn't want to called crazy, but, my Bother in law a while back I thought I would tell someone before I'm gone.

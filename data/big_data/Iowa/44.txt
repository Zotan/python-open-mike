Me and a couple friends have heard one in Iowa while out late at night cat fishing a few years ago! At first we thought it was just a coyote howling but, it was a real deep howl, like the Ohio call, but a few seconds later a pack of coyotes started yelping and barking and after that everything went silent, like something scared everything away!

Driving home one night from a ball game, with my daughter and her friend, I saw something crossing the road. My lights were on high-beam, and I was driving slowly because there are enough wild animals in the area to jump out of no where and they end up getting killed. Just something large, shiny, black, furry, walking across quickly....I knew it wasn't a cow as cows don't normally walk upright and I've seen enough cows on the road to know that normally I have to stop, but I didn't need to stop for this one.

Hello I had my first encounter about 18 years ago. I lived at that time at my parents house.. Me and my cousin where chilling on this log in a ravine talking and out of the corner of my eye I saw his dog chasing a rabbit then when I looked back a couple minutes later i saw the rabbit chasing the dog. I though that was strange didn't think anything of it. We headed back up the hill to the gate and when i shut the gate and ready to lock it up thats when we heard this blood gurling growl and howl we both looked at each other and ran down the hill and jumped the electrical fence and up the hill by our grandpas building I looked back and there it was so tall and stared at us for about 20 second then I seen him turn and head back down into the woods.  Then about 2 years ago I found this stick structure shed while I was hunting which looked out of place and odd. Then last year when deer hunting I seen this thing run through the woods and heard branches breaking, while leaning on a tree waiting for deer, very frightened didn't want to move.  South Skunk river close to our place too! We were down in a ravine in the timber by a pond.

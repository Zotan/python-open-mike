My Cousin and I were walking in the woods, in an area over-looking the Boone River.  We came to a steep ravine, just over the river and began to look around.  As I was glancing I saw something out of the corner of my eye, at first glance I thought that it was a deer, but upon closer inspection, It appeared to be a tall man.  I thought that it was my cousin's brother trying to scare us, as he is very tall.  But this thing was large and reddish brown, and within a few steps disappeared into the woods without a trace.

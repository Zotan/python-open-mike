I was eastbound on US 30 in Boone County.  I was descending into the the Des Moines River valley and saw 3 deer cross in front of me.  They were running fast like they were being chased.  I started slowing down and maybe 75 yrds behind them a very large bipedal object was running behind them. This thing was standing at the edge of the trees when I passed and it was HUGE.  Guessing the height I'd guess, the top of its head would have came up to the bottom of my window of my Volvo tractor.

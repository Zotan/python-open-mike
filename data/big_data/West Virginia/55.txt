Last summer either end of June or early July I was trout fishing the shavers fork of the cheat river in Randolph county, West Virginia. I was wading on one side of a fork in the river with an island type feature in the middle of the two streams and heard the snap of twigs. I looked to the island and briefly saw a figure that was roughly 60 yds away, very tall and dark brown or black in color. At first I thought it was a person but there was no facial features I could make out at that distance it was all dark I assumed covered in hair. My next thought is that it was a bear, but it walked away out of view moments after I had eyes on it, on two feet, and carried a staff with it. The staff was large, probably st least 5-6” in diameter, larger than I believe a human could or would wish to use as a walking stick. The figure moved to my right, downstream and quickly out of view. I was frozen with fear and unarmed at the time so there was no way I was going to pursue it. I’ve only told a handful of people about it and most think it wasn’t true expect my wife who knows when I am being sincere. Earlier this month I visited my father who I now know is a Bigfoot enthusiast and told him about the sighting. He had urged me to report on this website so now I’m getting around to actually doing it.

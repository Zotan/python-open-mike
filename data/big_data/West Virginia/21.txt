In the early morning hours of December 1st, 1997, I was hunting with my son when I heard some weird sounds coming from a nearby gully. The sounds observed were similar to that of a woman screaming, followed by a strange sort of chatter, as if someone were playing a recording of a human-like conversation backwards.

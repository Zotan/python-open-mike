During the winter of 1978-79, My family and I heard strange howels/screams around our rual home during the hours of 11:30 PM - 1:30 AM. During this time several drain pipes around our home were knocked down and what ever did this left many large, human-like footprints. These prints were seen by myself, brother, Mother and Father. My father, after the screaming ended, went outside and destroyed the prints. To this day, we believe that this was to keep us from being frightened. At this time I had read several books on the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery and was familure with the creature. My mother, to this day will not talk about the incident. I strongly believe that this was a Sasquatch passing through our area. These sounds contiunued for several days and then stopped.

Note: The actual witness does not have internet access. Report submitted by her niece. My aunt and my cousin both supposedly saw bigfoot on Spruce Fork Rd in Buckhannon (Upshur Co.), WV.Both claimed that the creatures they have seen were certainly not human, and not like any type of animal they have ever seen. They live in a very wooded, country area with many wild animals, and still, they have yet to seen anything similar. My cousin saw this creature just today of March 1, 2010. They are very credible individuals.

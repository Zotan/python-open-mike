It was on a clear day, sun shining, I was on my way to work, it was August 2002. I came around a turn and he/she came walking out of the woods, he walked up over the bank, took about 3 steps and walked up the other side of the bank, when he crossed the road he turned his head and looked at me and kept walking. He was reddish brown with long arms.

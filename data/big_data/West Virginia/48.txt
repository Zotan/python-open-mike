I used to work as a bartender in Canaan Valley WV and lived at the base of Dolly Sods Wilderness Area. On a mid-summer night around probably 3am, I had driven home, which was about a half hour drive. We had no neighbors and there were no lights on as I pulled up. I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill. I got out of my car and closed the door. Immediately after my car door closed I had the loudest, most intense scream I have ever heard in my life call out from near the wood line. I ran for the door of the house and once inside I grabbed a shotgun, floodlight, and went back to look outside for it, from inside the screen door of course. I never saw a thing or found a sign of anything. This was the first of three times this happened to me, my mother who lived there as well and also worked late had it scream at her several times(she said 4 or 5) as well, and my brother had it scream at him once.

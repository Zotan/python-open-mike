MY SON AND I WERE ON OUR WAY TO WORK THURSDAY AUGUST 10,2006 ,WE WERE ABOUT 2 MILES FROM OUR HOME  IN KENOVA W.V. . I TOLD HIM TO SLOW DOWN THERE IS A MAN CROSSING THE ROAD AHEAD, WHEN WE GOT CLOSER TO IT I SAID WHAT  IS THAT, HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND SAID IT WAS BIGFOOT. WE WERE VERY SURPRISED IN SHOCK AND VERY SCARED. WE LEFT THE AREA AND WENT ON TO WORK.I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND TOLD HIM IMMEDIATELY WHAT WE HAD SEEN.

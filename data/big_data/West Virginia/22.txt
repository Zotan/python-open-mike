I had just left the Cranberry River in the Monangahela National Forest where some family members were camping. I took a short cut through Cranberry Ridge that comes out in Camden on Gauley to get home. It was midnight (12:03 to be exact.) I was almost to the Webster County Line when I saw what I thought at first was some idiot in a monkey suit in the middle of the road in front of me. I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn't a man. He wasn't wearing shoes. His feet looked hairy. He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall. The hair was all even in length. He ran about quarter of a mile up the hill in front of me then tore through some elderberry bushes and disappeared down the mountain. I only got a really quick glimpse of his face so I can't accurately describe it. The next day I went back and looked at the spot where he ran through the bushes. There were some kind of prints in the mud holes in the road and the elderberry bushes were broken and bent where it went through.

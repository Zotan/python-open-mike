I was deer hunting not to far from Angola Bay Game Land in Duplin County NC I was walking through the woods by the Northeast Cape Fear River and observed a red tinted figure approximately 8 to 9 ft tall it looked like it was taking a drink of water I was so frozen by what I was seeing I couldn't move from the shock. It took a drink and looked up and I believed it seen me got and got up and just walked off in the distance over a hill and it was gone. Needless to say I ran hard for at least 2 miles and haven't been back since then.

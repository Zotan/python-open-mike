well i was heading to a friends house about 11 P.M. he lives right across the road so i just walked. And i got about 3/4 of the way there and i was walking through a feild and saw something standing there on the edge of some pines. so i stoped and watched it for about 10 seconds and it didnt move much so i just kept walking real slow. then all the sudden it turned around real quick and looked at me for a second and then started screaming and ran of through the pines and didnt stop screaming for like a minute. i havent saw it sense then.

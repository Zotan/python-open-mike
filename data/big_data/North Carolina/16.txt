I was spending the night at a friends house, after a day's hunting in the nearby woodlands and swamps. It was about 3:00am in the morning, when I awoke to a 'howling', or 'wailing' sound  just outside the house, coming from the direction of the woods. This lasted for probably 30 seconds to a minute. My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now. I downloaded the "Howl.wav" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely 'organic' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas. Although I have no further evidence to back up my claims, I thought this would be worthy to report. I'd be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with.

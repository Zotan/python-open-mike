MY WIFE WAS AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW WASHING HER HANDS WHEN SHE HOLLERED "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT."   SHE SAID SOMETHING LARGE AND DARK JUST RUN PAST THE WINDOW ABOUT 15 FEET OUT. SHE SAID IT MOVED SO FAST SHE COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS , BUT IT WAS TALL ENOUGH THAT SHE COULD SEE THE HEAD & SHOULDERS. SHE SAID IT WAS TOO TALL TO BE HUMAN.  THE NEXT EVENING I WENT OUT TO FEED MY DOGS AND NOTICED A 20 TO 30 FOOT SAPLING , IT HAD TWO MAIN TRUNKS , ONE IS BENT OVER THE OTHER HAD BEEN SNAPPED ABOUT 3 FOOT FROM THE GROUND. I HAD SEEN THIS BEFOR IN THE WOODED AREA BEHIND OUR HOUSE , I JUST NEVER SEEN TREES JUST BENT OVER THAT WAY.

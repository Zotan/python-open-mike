I was driving down a logging road, passing a J hole in the road. To my left BF caught my eye as it started to slide down the embankment, on its feet. Standing up, almost sking. I turned toward him, following him in my pickup, as close as his arm reach. Im not a journalist, so if someone would care to call me about this I would be more than happy to describe my encounter. I had a great view of him for 20 to 30 seconds, walking along side then in front on my pickup.

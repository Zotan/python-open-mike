We saw a large dark image by the road and thought it was maybe part of a moose.  My husband slowed the car down and then here came this large tall, dark green and black figure across the road.  He was at the side of the road and took one step to the middle line, then another step to cross the other half of the highway, his third step was across a ditch and gone in the forest. We looked but never saw anything in the woods after he crossed.  His head was shaggy and we could not see a face. The shag that covered his head looked like long tightly wound hair hanging down.  His, what looked like arms, hung down below his knees and he swung them back and forth as he walked.  He had big feet that were the same color as the rest of his body. One step was about as big as a lane on the highway

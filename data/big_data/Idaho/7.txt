The witness is a retired California Highway Patrol Officer. Witness says he was driving northbound on Highway 95 from Coeur d'Alene, headed for a business appointment in Bonner's Ferry, a town about 80 miles north of Coeur d"Alene. This occurred last summer in the early morning hours. Possibly on a Sunday. He was in an area near Coeur d'Alene, possibly only 5 to 10 miles north of Hayden Idaho. He happened to look in his  rearview mirror of his car, and saw this large unidentified man looking creature walking across the roadway just behind his vehicle.

I was lying in my tent on the last night of our camping trip.  I remember thinking about a story my brother told me about an incident several years earlier where he and my other brother encountered a bear in this same area.  I was on the verge of drifing off to sleep when suddenly an overwhelming sense of dread and fear overcame me.  I was immediately wide awake, but was afraid to make any noise so I remained still.  I heard footsteps very near my tent.  I could feel the presence of something very large.  It moved slowly and I could hear what sounded like deep throated breathing.  When I heard whatever it was move closer to my tent, I sat up as quietly so I could put my glasses on and grabbed my .44 magnum revolver.  I wasn't even thinking about sasquatch at the time.  I was afraid a bear had possibly wandered into camp.  I finally got the courage to turn on my flashlight and everything outside went silent.  I heard no more sounds, and never smelled anything unusual.  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone.  I did not hear anything running away, but I felt safe and was able to relax enough to go back to sleep.  Nothing else happened that night.

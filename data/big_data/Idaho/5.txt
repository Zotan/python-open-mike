This incident occurred 15 years ago(1982) when I was a teenager. Initially started out hearing a loud sound, that thought at 1st was an elk bugle. My grandfather disagreed. This occurred in the evening. The next morning, as we were preparing to pack into some of the local lakes, discovered a single track in a marshy area near the trail head.

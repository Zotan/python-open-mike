During an evening hunting trip the two of us were driving up a fairly rough patch of road looking for deer sign, it was the last day of the season and was pretty late, around 4 pm or so.  The weather was a little foggy with a light rain. I had stopped the truck to look up a small ridge about 300 or so yards away.  I saw what looked like a very large Bigfoot standing at the top of the ridge near a tree.  I told myself that it was probably just a large stump that looked like a silhouette of Bigfoot on the ridge.  I even pointed it out to my 12 year old son, that that stump looked just like a Bigfoot.  We both laughed and agreed that it did. We continued up the little road for less than 100 yards, and found that it was a dead end.  We turned around and on the way down I looked back to where I saw the stump, and it was gone!. Less than 3 minutes had gone by. I stopped the truck and told my son that the stump was gone.  We searched the skyline and couldn't find it again. To this day, I really do not know what that was on the skyline, and I am not convinced that it was in fact a Bigfoot (I am a beliver), but it was something that I can not explain.

I didn't actually see anything. My wife woke me up around 1:30 am. She was giving me a hard time for the smell in the cabin (she thought I was passing gas). I told her it wasn't me. I had the window open and the fan was on blowing the cold air on me. There was this stench coming from outside. It was the most horrible smell I have ever smelled in my  life. It was a mix of nasty fecal matter (diarrhea) and body sweat/odor. I immediately shut the fan off and the smell started to go away. I didn't even think about going outside until later on in the morning about 10:00 am when we were eating breakfast. We hadn't mentioned anything to our kids but my son said he didn't sleep well the night before. He said he heard something outside of the cabin and thought it was probably a deer but he kept waking up feeling like something was staring at him through the window in the living room. Every time he would wake up, he'd look at the window. He said he thought for sure something was outside of the window staring at him. If indeed there was something or someone outside of the window staring at him then they would have to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall because the window is about that high off of the ground outside of the cabin. I didn't know if this incident was worth mentioning but I thought I would share it anyway. I did go outside and carefully searched the area around the cabin for any tracks but couldn't see any but our own and our dogs. Our dog was inside of the cabin sleeping in her crate in, the kitchen. She made no noise through the night.

I saw an upright animal standing on the road on the north side of the Salmon River.  It was after dark and I caught him in my headlights.  He stood for about 10 seconds. in my headlights and then jumped off the bank down into the river bottom. The animal was about 7 feet  tall, remained upright, was brown in color, and his eyes showed green in the headlights. When he jumped off the road, the creature was very agile and jumped easily.

I was a boy scout attending scout camp in a camp that BSA own in McCall called Camp Morrison. My friend and I were walking back to our campsite which was called Camp Billyrice. It's right by the entrance to Camp Morrison. We were closer to camp Ida Haven at this point walking back from the waterfront. We stayed too late and it had gotten dark, as we passed over this stream I saw something off to the side. We stopped on the small bridge, and froze. I thought it was a guy in a Gilly suit at first, but he was crouched next to the stream slowly drinking water with his hand. he turned and looked at us then he stood up straight and I could see in the moonlight he was not in a Gilly suit, but covered in fur. He had really long arms and was at least 8 feet tall, maybe more. I could see the moonlight reflecting off his green eyes and for the whole minute or two that we stood frozen staring at each other he didn't blink once. Then he turned away, crouched back down, and continued slowly drinking with his hand. My friend and I got scared and ran off. We never told anyone because we were scared and thought no one would believe us. I didn't perceive him as a threat though, and I think he didn't perceive us as a threat either.

I was on a river trip on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Northern, ID. We camped at Scout Camp at river mile 12.7 on June 6th, 2013 for our first night. There is a natural hot springs called sheepeater hot springs about a half mile hike down river. The other members of our group hiked to the hot springs about a half hour ahead of myself as I helped my dad finish cleaning up dinner and then hiked along the river to the hots springs by myself. I was a half mile down the trail before it ascends up along a cliff side next to the mountain to my left when a rock was thrown at me. I thought I was crazy at first as a second rock went in front of me and hit the bank finally rolling into the river. I did not see what was throwing the rocks, but had a very strange feeling come over me. My first conclusion was that one of the people in the group ahead was on the hill side doing this. I continued along the trail and arrived at the hot springs asked all of them if it was them and it was not.

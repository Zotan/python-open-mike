I was just out for a walk up in the hills from our house that is about two miles out of town in the woods (where we have heard some strange howls before in the summer) and I was about three miles from the house in the hills down the valley when I came across a set of prints on the ground about 15-17 inch long on pretty wide with a set of toes, I step on one before i realized what they were and so I took a couple of photos

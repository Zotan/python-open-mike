My neice went out to roll the windows up on my daughters car when she heard someone hollering at her.  She looked toward a field next to the house and seen something white standing there. It kept making the noise and spooked her so she ran back in the house to tell us. Shortly after this our dogs started barking. My daughters boyfriend took a flashlight out next to the fence to see if he could see anything. He ran in the house to get the gun because he heard some movement. When he returned to the fence he shined the flashlight toward the woods again. What he saw stunned him for a few seconds. He said it was a huge white fury creature. He fired the gun and the creature stumbled and took off runing. While all this was taking place my daughter and neice were standing on the porch and witnessed the whole thing. They seen enough of the creature to describe it as being a huge, white furry creature on two feet instead of four. They also heard the low deep grunt my neice had already heard earlier.

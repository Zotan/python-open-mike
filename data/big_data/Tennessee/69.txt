While home from college on holiday break I was out visiting friends one night.  I had pulled over and was outside the car in a remote area near my home (parents home) with a friend.  While outside the car, some movement caught my eye on a rock cliff on the opposite side of the road and approx. 100' away.  I saw a figure approx. 7' tall, broad from shoulders down through torso, large head, covered entirely with dark (hair), standing upright with arms straight down by side.  No eyes, mouth, ears noticeable.  I stood still for 10-15 seconds starring at the image; then, it turned to it's left and disappeared.  No sounds made.  I hurried my friend back into the car and asked him if he saw what I saw and he said he only got a brief glimpse of a shadowy movement.  Although I definitely saw as described, I have dismissed this as being a person, maybe a hunter in the area.  And, I was looking upward at the time so the image could have been distorted.  But, readings of other similar sightings since has prompted me to submit this occurrence.

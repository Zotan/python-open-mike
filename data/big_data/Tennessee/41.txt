Earlier this year i was camping by myself in the Citico Creek area. Around Ten oclock P.M. i was in my hammock (i dont use a tent,i go lightweight)when i heard something,i guess you could say running down a steep hill across the trail from me.At first i thought it was a deer or some other animal but it stopped and started moving parallel with the trail. So i get up and get my fire going again to try and spook what ever it was off. Whatever was moving (ill just say IT from now on)went down about fifty yards and crossed the trail over to my side. I was kind of freaking out because it was so overgrown with vegatation that a flashlight was almost useless.I could hear IT cross back over the trail and move up the hill and come back the way IT came. It went past my camp about fifty yards or so and crossed the trail this time above where i was.About this time i figured out that it wasnt an animal so i was freaking out a little.This went on for about four or five hours off and on.When the sun came up i got out of there.I told some friends about what happened they thought it was probably a deer or maybe a dog but it sounded way to heavy for either of those.I done some research and came across your sight and kind of got it out of my system you could say but i saw where you guys had a expedition to North Carolina and saw some articles where people had encounters around the N.C. and T.N. border well thats where i was.

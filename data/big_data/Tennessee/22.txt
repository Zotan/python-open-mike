I believe it was May 2010, I was with my son and was crossing railroad tracks, I looked down the tracks and said to my son what is that, about a block or so down the tracks was a creature standing in the middle of the tracks, it was big shaggy, light brown, standing on two legs...I didn't know what to think except that I saw a bigfoot...this happened in Monroe County,Tenn.

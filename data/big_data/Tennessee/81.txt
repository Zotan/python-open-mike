my wife and i were talking to her brother and his girlfriend on the back porch of my in-laws. My wife and i were facing the house and my brother-in-law and girlfriend were facing us. In the midst of our conversation, we heard a loud scream. Growing up in the country and raised on a farm, i have heard most of the common North American animal calls.  I have NEVER heard anything that screamed like this. We had about 300 yards of field and yards before it turned to woods. We didnt see it, but it sounded almost as if it were just behind us. At the same time, there was another approx. 1/2 mile down the road and they were yelling back and forth as if they were talking. The lungs on these creatures were amazing!

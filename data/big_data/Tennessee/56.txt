at 2:30 a.m. on wednesday september the 1 2004 my brother called me on the telephone and told me that he had been outside to hook a car trailer to his truck. he said he went in the house to get a flashlight and when he came back outside he heard a noise so he shined the light up into the woods to look around, and as he came around with the light something reflected the beam and when he came back to the spot of the reflection in the grass just on the other side of his truck there was a creature that looked like a man covered in long shiny black hair with eyes about the size of a horses. it was squatting down with its arms around its knees just staring at him and when the light hit it in the eyes it just turned its head away. that is when he went in to call me. while we were on the phone he opened the door to see if it was still there and you could hear it running through the woods yelling. the reason i am on this sight is to see if we can get some help and some answers.

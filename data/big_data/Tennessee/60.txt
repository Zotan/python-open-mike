While on a day trip to a very remote local cemetery in the pine barrens near Appleton, Tennessee my family and friends observed a freshly fallen tree across Sugar Creek about 150 yards south of the Mt. Zion Church entryway. Visitors have to cross a low water bridge on Sugar Creek at this point. Was a very pleasant day in May (31st), with blue skies and a light breeze. After about a half an hour we heard what could only be described as the most unholy sound any of us have ever heard coming from the area past the fallen tree on Sugar Creek (about 1000yds away from us). It was no cow, donkey, horse, etc. My wife and best friend heard this sound and in fact captured it on our camcorder. It is nowhere as loud as it was in person, but I do have it recorded.

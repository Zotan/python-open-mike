I has hunting on short mountain.it was oct.2006. i was in my tree stand deer hunting and i seen a couple of deer and then they ran off realy fast. this was about 8:00 am.so i stayed in my stand til around 9:00am then packed up and headed out.thats when i heard a growling noise and it was coming from the thick brush.i was walking on the river bank looking up at the brush.it was following me so i started to walk faster and it started shaking the trees very hard. and they were good size trees.i never seen what is was and i know there is no bears there and a bear wouldnt do what i seen.i would like to know what i seen and herd that day.

I was out last night walking our dogs; I walk them one at a time which usually takes about 15 minutes.  I heard what sounded like what I've heard the investigators on FINDING BIGFOOT do when "callling" to a bigfoot.  It was coming from about 1 mile away from the Tombigbee Water Way.  We're on the west side of the waterway.  We're in a rural area and are accustomed to hearing a variety of animal noises but, I've never heard this sound before.  We hear coyotes all the time and I suppose it's possible this could have been a coyote but, it struck me as being a sound like I've heard the investigators making on tv.  I heard it twice during the time I was out with the dogs and even mentioned it to my husband when I came in. Please understand that I did NOT see anything.  I only heard what sounded like what I've heard on the television show which sounded nothing like what I'm used to hearing out here.

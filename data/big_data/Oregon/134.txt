My aunt and uncle, who lived on the edge of town, heard a burgler going thru stuff on the back porch late at night. Looked out an seen a huge bigfoot lookin thru stuff. My aunt screamed and bigfoot run off. About same time a neighbor said he almost hit a bigfoot with his truck, coming home from night shift. This really happened.

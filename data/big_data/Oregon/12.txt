Creature 7 to 8 feet tall was sighted by my wife and son at  9:15 pm 01/09/02 near Multnomah Falls.  It crossed the freeway in front of their vehicle before going over guard rail toward the Columbia River. They nearly hit it in the westbound lane. She called me from her cell phone and told me what just happened.

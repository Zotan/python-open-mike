I let my dog out at about 6 AM this morning, he usually stays out 1-2 hours but demanded back in immediately. About 7:30 and there was the strong smell of sewage and I could hear branches breaking along the side of my home, nothing new as deer go by often.  I didnâ€™t think too much of it. I got up and went to the bathroom as I was walking in I could see something and took a closer look.  A large animal, blackish, walking upright going up the hill into the cemetery behind my home.

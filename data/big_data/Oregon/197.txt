What I saw was a thing about 6 foot tall, all black and short hair, its body was skinny and its forearms were bigger than its biceps. It was leaning over, drinking out of a stream by the path I was walking on. It had to be very strong because wen I came walking by, it stood up on two legs very fast and grabbed on to the tree behind it to help it up the hill. This thing I saw almost looked like a monkey except way too tall to be a monkey and also way to skinny to be a bear and too fast.

While sitting in the Blazer (with 3 other females ranging in age from 13-34 all of which were sleeping) that was broken down waiting for help to return I noticed on the east side that there seemed to be something peeking out from a tree aprox. 20' into the woods. I was thinking that it could have been a trick of lighting and the wind moving some branches as the only time I seemed to be seeing movement was when I was looking straight ahead to the north the direction the Blazer was headed and this was out of the corner of my right eye to the east and every time I would move my head to the right it would stop. I played this game for a while, but decided that if I was really seeing something, that I was going to have to turn my head to the right. I dozed off for a while and when I awoke I was still looking off to the right (east) and there was something peeking around a tree that was closer more like 15' or so, so I just kept my eyes on the object and was able to make out!that it was tall, hairy, light coloring in the face except for the eye and mouth area. It didn't move but just like a shifting of feet once in a while. It didn't advance any more, but seemed intent on watching what was going on or in seeing just what it was that it was looking at. I couldn't smell anything as the wind was blowing to the east. I didn't awake anyone because I didn't want to scare them. I didn't feel threatened, but I wasn't going to go and check it out either. At 3:30 help arrived and so I concentrated on what needed to be done to get the broken-down rig off the hill.

Heard extremely loud howl or call; started off low and then would  go higher then carry off (like a peacock makes only a lower, harder vocalization); sounded like from a very large animal- was very  loud; would do these howls over and over again for about 30 seconds. Dogs in area would bark and howl while this was going on and they seemed generally agitated until it stopped.

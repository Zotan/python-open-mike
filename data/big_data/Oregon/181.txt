MY WIFE'S GRANDFATHER WANTED TO TAKE ME FLY FISHING AT THE LITTLE PUDDING RIVER. HE ONLY HAD ONE POLE SO I WENT TO WATCH.   WE PARKED NEAR THE BRIDGE AND WALK EAST UP THE RIVER.  HE POINTED TO A STACK OF ROCKS AND ASKED ME IF I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE.  I TOLD HIM NO.  HE SAID BIG FOOT DOES THAT. I SAID OK, SURE.  AS WE WALKED UP THE RIVER WE SAW THEM ABOUT EVERY 200 FEET.  I WADED ACROSS TO WHERE THEY WERE AND HE SAID "DON'T TOUCH THEM". AFTER WE PASSED THE 4TH ROCK PILE HE PUT DOWN HIS POLE AND WE WADED ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE. HE TOLD ME TO STAY PUT.  HE WAS GONE FOR ABOUT 10 MIN.  HE CAME BACK AND TOLD ME NOT TO TALK AND FOR ME TO FOLLOW. WE WALKED ABOUT 50 YARDS INTO THE WOODS UNTIL WE CAME TO A BIG FALLEN TREE.   HE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET. I SAW IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR TREES THAT THERE WERE SMALL BRANCHES PACKED DOWN AND RED BROWN TUFTS OF HAIR.  IT SMELLED LIKE AN ANIMAL HAD DIED.  IT TURNED MY STOMACH. I ALSO SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS CHICKEN FEATHERS IN THE DEN.  WE WALKED OUT AND BACK TO THE RIVER.  HE TOLD ME THAT I JUST SAW A BIG FOOT DEN.  HE WAS 87 YEARS OLD.  I NEVER THOUGGHT MUCH ABOUT BIG FOOT.  I DONT KNOW IF IT WAS OR NOT.  HE DIED 3 YEARS LATER.  HE WAS THE GRUMPIEST MAN I EVER MET. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.  I BELIEVED THAT HE REALLY THOUGHT WHAT HE SHOWED ME WAS THE TRUTH .

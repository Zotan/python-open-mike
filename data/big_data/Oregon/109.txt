On Saturday about 5:45 AM my hunting partner and I were walking down a gravel road and heard a loud scream from up hill above us. The scream started in a high pitch and went into more of a gruntal growl and echoed through the canyon. After a brief discussion I told my friend that it sounded like something was mad that we were out there and wanted to scare everything in the canyon. The next day at approx. 8:00 pm. we were hunting high above the canyon on the next ridge. I was the first back to the pickup and sat down about 30 yds. away to watch for elk. Suddenly i heard something coming down the hill through the burned trees. it sounded like another hunter, only it was being very loud. I stood up to try and see what it was but the wind picked up and blew my scent toward it. The sound stopped for a few seconds and it turned and ran back up the hill. I ran out the road to try and see what it was. By this time it had reached the top and was running upright along the ridge. I caught three or four glimpses through the burned trees before it went over the ridge. About 10 seconds later I heard two loud screams like before. My friend called me on the radio to ask if I heard it and to tell me he was heading in. I walked further out the road to meet him. As we were talking about it, we heard it once more. The thing I saw was walking upright, about six ft. tall and looked like a man with no neck in a ghilli suit.

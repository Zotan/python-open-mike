November 2013 We live near the Umatilla River just 2-3 miles outside of Pendleton, OR on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.  It is not a remote area.  We are surrounded by farm ground and a couple neighbors within a couple thousand yards or so on a dirt road. We sleep with our bedroom window cracked about 2 inches open so the bedroom stays very cool. I awakened around 12:30AM and sat straight up in bed because I had heard something.  It was very quiet in the house and no unusual noise outside but I had heard "something" that woke me up wide awake. Listening intently for several minutes, I heard this weird and very loud wailing, screaming, laughing noise that sounded like a cross between a woman hysterically screaming and then quickly changing to hyena-like laughing and almost a "wooping" yell. I jumped out of bed and ran to the front door that opens to farmland and low rolling hills.  It sounded like several hundred yards out.  It repeated 3-4 times, each getting quickly farther away like it was running. I did not awaken my spouse. A couple weeks later, the same thing occurred late at night.  Then, a few days later around Christmas/New Years the local newspaper ran a story about "Bigfoot" scaring tribal members and people at night.  There was also a large number of phone recordings of the same crazy maniacal laughter I had heard.  The residents started calling it the "Umatilla Screamer".

On June 4, 200l, I stopped at a beach north of Brookings, Oregon for my usual evening walk with my Golden Retriever.  When we crossed the creek (near where it empties into the ocean), to get to the north & rugged end of the beach, my dog--who normally runs a block ahead of me--froze.  She did NOT wish to walk anywhere in this area.  We turned around and took a walk on the south beach.  At 7:15 p.m., heading up the path to the parking lot, I happened to glance up at the steep hills on the north.  I was stunned to see what appeared to be 2 very large men--both dressed completely in black.  I looked again to determine if they were a threat to me, and saw they were, in fact, covered in black, and it probably wasn't dark clothing.  The figures walked in a hunched-over posture, one right in front of the other, arms swinging like apes, and taking very long strides.  They seemed to see me and appeared to be coming toward me.  I started to run to my Chevy Blazer.  Part-way there, I turned to see if I was being pursued--only to make eye-contact with a large doe (perhaps less than 100' away).

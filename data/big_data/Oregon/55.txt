My wife and son and myself were up archery hunting out of Friend Oregon in the Mt Hood National Forest. they had walked up a road to check it out while I waited in the truck for them to return. They soon returned and asked if I had heard a loud whoop type sound. At that time I had not heard anything. They both seemed kind of shaken a bit. I got out of the truck and no sooner got to the back by the tailgate and whatever this was sounded off with a loud whoop sound. We all started walking to the tree line. My son decided to do a whoop sound just goofing off and we got a louder whoop sound back that's where it all started. The whoop sounds got louder in front of us and started from the left, the middle, farther away in the middle and to the right of us. It lasted for several minutes. My wife and son had there phones recording also. We have it recorded. I have been hunting these woods for over 20 years. I know what bear, coyote, cattle, cougars, birds etc sound like. This is not even close of anything I have ever heard. A couple days prior to that my wife mentioned a really foul strong smell. My oldest son said he heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick like knocks. the video says it all. I also know we were the only people in that area at the time.

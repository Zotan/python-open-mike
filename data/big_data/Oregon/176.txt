While I was archery hunting on Aug 31, 2004 near Maxwell Butte, I found two tracks that measured 14x5 inches, both tracks had a prominent large toe on the side of the track. The tracks were not together but on the same ridge. I also found a feces pile that was like bear in contents (berry seeds) but much larger and more human-like.  it was like a fifty cent piece in diameter and 12-14 inches long. I had a visitor the next morning at 4 am. I was sitting in my dimly lit tent listening for elk bugling. I woke at 3 am and was wide awake drinking coffee and hoping to get a head start on my hunt by hearing elk. I was surprised by a low growl that sounded like it came from my stomach. I thought it was odd that I didn't feel it, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind a loud scraping sound was followed by a loud thud that came from the thick patch of trees next to my tent, only 2-3 feet away, I heard no other sound after that. I slapped the table top [inside the tent] hoping to hear something leave but whatever stomped the ground didn't make another sound. I put my boots on, grabbed an axe and went outside yelling, hoping to scare off the animal but I never heard another sound. I think a bear would have been more obvious. This animal was able to get next to my tent and leave without me noticing anything except for the growl and the stomp.

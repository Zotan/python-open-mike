Myself and my two cousins were out hunting.  I had met up with my younger cousin and we both hiked up to an old logging road.  We then heard a very loud scream come from across a valley.  It was about a mile or so across and the scream seemed so loud at first I thought that some lady was screaming for help or something.  The screaming lasted for just a short time, mabey 30-45 seconds or so.  I Asked my cousins what that sound was and they said they have never heard it before even though they have hunted these woods for about seven years now.  I then remembered that I read in a book that sasquatch sometimes make a loud screaming noise.  I still do not know exactly what made that noise.

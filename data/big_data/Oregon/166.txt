As I was coming down into the lake country as I call it.   The wind was blowing from my left to my right.  I picked up this bad smell, almost like something had died.   I looked to my left and next to the trees 15 or 20 ft. away was this upright dark haired creature standing there looking at me.   I said geese what the hell is that.  Then this creature turned and went into the trees.  To be honest I did not follow it.  It scared the devil out of me.  I have not returned.  I'm not sure I want to.

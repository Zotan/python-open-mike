While bow hunting on Mt. Emily in 1982 my wife and I took a drive to the summit off exit 243 aprox. 15 miles up the forest road. When we reached the top I noticed what I thought was another hunter sitting at the base of a tree as I turned to take another look what I saw stood up and walked across the road stopping to look at us before it descended down the hill on the other side. I went to where I last saw it I concluded it was aprox 8 ft tall from a tree it had stood next to when it stopped to look our way. I then realized what we had seen was not a hunter or a bear. It was a hot august afternoon no tracks to prove what I had seen but I will never be told otherwise what we observed that day.

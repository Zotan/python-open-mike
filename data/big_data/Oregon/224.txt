We heard three unbelievably low-toned grunts outside of our tent at dawn (around 5 am) on Tueday, September 24th, 2013.  Our tent is about 7 feet high when set up and the grunts sounded about a foot or two higher than the tent and about 6 feet away. The grunts sounded like "huuhhh-huuhhh-huuhhh,"  very low pitched.

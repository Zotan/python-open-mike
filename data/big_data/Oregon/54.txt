We were camping at Lower Twin Lake in the Mt. Hood National Forest, and after dark, we were sitting around the fire when my daughter tried doing a bigfoot howl. About 10 seconds after the howl, we heard a tree knock. There were no other people camping nearby. There were 6 of us around the fire, 3 adults and 3 kids. It was midweek, and there were no other campsites being used around the lake. The knock came from a ridge high above the lake.

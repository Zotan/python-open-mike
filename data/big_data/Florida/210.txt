My mom was driving down the road going to my grandmother and aunt's house, when she saw it. It ran out into the road, stopped in the headlights for a second, and then continued to run out to the other side of the road....like crossing the street. It looked tall, according to her about 6 feet. And it was a bit skinny, with hair all over it's body.

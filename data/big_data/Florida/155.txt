The incident happened two years ago in the Richloam Hunting Area in centeral Florida. The Green Swamp. My friend and I had been awake for fifteen minutes. We were sitting around the fire. I had just stoked the fire and added some more wood. That is when we heard something walking toward us in the woods. After it came to the road, it continued through the middle of the campsite, which led to the river,  and then the other way into the woods. The animal ran down towards the water then turned around, ran back up the road and into the woods. At this time it went on the back side of the campsite.  My friend and I were shocked, we thought it might be a bigfoot but decided to go hunting. Once we got out of the stand we went to go investgate what had happened, and that is when we saw the footprints left in the sand. The foot prints were proably 16" long and far too wide to be human.  There were five toes.

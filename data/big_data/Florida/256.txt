I was driving home from work one night, down CR220 (Middleburg) turned left on SR21 (Blanding Blvd) and when I rounded the corner, my headlights caught sight of 2, not human or animals, standing by the speed limit sign and when they heard my vehicle/seen the headlights- they stopped (looked like they were rustling w/ something) and looked up.

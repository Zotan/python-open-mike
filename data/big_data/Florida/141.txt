I was on my way back from a delivery in okeechobee on I 95 near mile marker 158 in when i noticed people hitting their brakes and pointing out to the right,upon looking i saw an 8 foot tall hairy creature whose arms were past its waist in lenghth,standing upright but shoulders were hunched over,it was taking small strides in between the cypress trees behind the fence on the side of the road,about fifteen feet into the trees.I couldnt see it face,but its whole body was black hair,it wasnt thin by any means.I didnt see any features that would have made me feel that it was female..It was about 3:15 P.M on Friday the 21st of January 2012.

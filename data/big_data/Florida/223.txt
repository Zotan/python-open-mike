I would never have made any type of report about this incident but after listening to the first 2 audio recordings on your site I was compelled to tell you about an incident that I experienced along with 2 of my friends. It was fall of 2000 and we were riding in a jeep through the woods north of Panama City in a wooded area near the power plant off of hwy 77.  We were doing some low grade four wheel driving in an area that falls between immediate coastline and some heavily wooded areas; areas that are sometimes incredibly thick and densely wooded swamps.  We happened to stop the jeep in order to make a navigational decision when we all heard the loudest and definitely the strangest sound I had ever heard.  It was truly beyond description and I am not a person to be lost for descriptors.  The three of us immediately began a "did you hear that?" dialogue when we heard essentially the same noise again. The only reason I bothered to submit this is because of those audio clips.  I am an audio engineer and am very familiar with sound.  In addition I have lived in this area for the majority of my life having spent many days and nights in the woods hearing and seeing all sorts of things.  This was, until tonight, beyond my experience.  None of us could, with any certainty, say what we heard.

I saw a bigfoot while driving between Bronson and Williston on 27 east, in June of 1991. It was about 4:00 in the afternoon, it was a clear and sunny day. The bigfoot ran about 100 yards across the road in abount 20 seconds. It was about 70 yards ahead of us, it appeared to be carrying a small bigfoot child in its arms,it appeared to be about 8 feet tall and completely covered in hair.

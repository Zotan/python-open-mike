We were driving up 73rd Ave E, in Myakka City, Florida. The road has been used infrequently due to the recent storms. As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass. I thought to myself that it was odd to see a large pile of soggy grass and moss that was oddly shaped so symmetrically. Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... “Honey” I said to my husband, “I just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching down”. He could tell by the look on my face that I had, in fact, seen something. I still can’t believe it, I’m chuckling nervously talking about it... unbelievable. It was a dark mound of crouched flesh and soggy hair. I could not see it’s face just the pointed head and massive shoulders. The fence is 4.5’ tall and it was another 3’ higher and just as wide. No one is ever going to believe me, but I just had to report it.

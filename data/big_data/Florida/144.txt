well we were rideing our atv's and we turnd an corner and in the distince we saw a big black thing,  at first we thought it was another atver but as we got closer it started to look like a person cuz it had alot of hair ...he was just standing looking at us then my brother pointed and said "look!" then we all saw him turn and run into the bushes. he was hunched and he was black then we went down there and we didnt see him then we saw footprints and it wasnt just any footprints they were prety big they were about 3 feet and we didnt here anything cuz we had our helmets on and the atvs are pretty loud.

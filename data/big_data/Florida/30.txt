A large, hairy, ape-like humanoid standing in the middle of a dirt road at approximately 3:30am. A creature was sighted in the headlights of the witness' pickup truck. As the witnesses stopped their truck the creature began to approach them. The middle part of the creature was closely observed in the headlights and confirmed not to be a bear or any other known animal. Both witnesses reported a sickening odor that smelled like cabbage. The smell was so overwelming that one of the witnesses began to gag. This report was never reported to the authorities or the media. This information was first made available to the researcher in 1995 by witness, P.S.

While waiting (not knowing my son had been injured and was taken to Orlando Hospital) I was inside the camper and had lowered the tent flaps slightly to allow air flow. The opening would have been approx. 7 feet off the ground.  I suddenly heard the loudest breathing right outside the opening. I became very frightened and screamed, "get out of here!". Just about that time a ranger pulls in with my husband and son.  The shock (I fainted) of seeing my son made me forget this incident. We are huge BFRO fans. After watching stories of sightings, my memory was jarred. This thing had to be 7 or 8 feet tall and huge. After recalling this, I don't believe I would camp there again.  My grandson encouraged me to file this report as we have been reading the BFRO website reports. Better late than never.

We were in an open field when we heard the creature first. It made sort of a howling/growling type of noise.We went towards the tree line where the sound came from. It was crouched down slightly and then stood up as we got close.It was about 8 feet tall. It then ran off, extremely fast, towards the swamp. We were all armed, but decided it would not be a good idea to follow it into the swamp. When we reached the spot  it was at, we noticed it had shreaded the bark off the tree it was behind.

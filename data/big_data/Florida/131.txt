I am 51 years old, and have trapped, hunted, fished, and camped all my life. I was scouting for deer sign in the fall on a swampy island that I can only reach by using chest waders.  It was cold, clear early afternoon, and as I walked along near the edge of the island, things got very quiet and I stopped all of a sudden--why I don't know--and I heard what started out as an owl hooting but ended with a monkey type sound. Sort of: "whooo-whooo-whooo-oo-oo-ahh-ahh". I only heard it once--and got the distinct feeling that another presence was in the woods beside myself. Owl's have many calls I know, but I thought this was unusual given the time of day and weather being clear.

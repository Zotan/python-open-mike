You have had an encounter with my family, the Bridges over in Quincy, Florida. I now live in jacksonville, Fl. with my boyfriend, his mothers friend has a lake house in Lake Crosby. We took a day trip out there and as we were walking from the end of the dock up to the lake house. It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size. We jumped off the dock to get a closer look, it was exactly how a big foot print looks. It was about 11-12 inches long and 5 inches wide. While we were there, there was ducks in the water near shore. The area is very swampy like a marsh, and deserted from a lot of human commotion. Furthermore, my knowledge provokes me to go back to where it was sighted and do further research ourselves. We do believe the area is habitat to big foot. To have your opinion about the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

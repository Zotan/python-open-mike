Walked out the door with phone in hand. Stood on front porch and sat down on porch step. Looked toward east side of property near chicken coop. I caught a quick glimpse of a tall hairy figure standing in woods and then running. Figure was taller that 6 foot. After it ran off I heard knocking in the woods. Prior to this my dad walked toward the coop and something growled at him. He ran back in and got his gun and it ran away.

I saw something, but I am unsure.  it was near the large park in bartow where they play baseball etc. We were on the top of the hill fishing and the others were checking the lines. There was something in the water staring at me very dark colored black looked hairy. I was in a trance and couldn't move. It was stuck out of the water at least chest high not sure what it was. When the others came back I started telling them. I started to point to show them where I saw it and it was gone. I had sat there and stared at it even closing my eyes and then looking  again or averting my eyes and then looking it kept staring. Then it when the others showed up it disappeared.

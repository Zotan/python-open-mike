The witness was driving to Cocoa around 11 am. He pulled over to relieve himself and found the tracks. The tracks were backed up to a large gate approx. 4.5 feet tall. It appeared to look as if the creature walked across Nova Rd. from west to east, stepped over the gate and continued east into a wooded tree line. There were 6 tracks in all covering about 30 feet of ground. After that the ground slooped down into a gully with weeds and water, then back up into the trees. The witness took 2 photos of the tracks. The tracks measured approx. 13 inches long by 8 1/2 inches wide.

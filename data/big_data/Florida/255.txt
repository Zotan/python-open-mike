It was a Monday, the first day of school. when i woke up at 8:00AM i heard my dogs barking. So i went outside and was trying to get the to settle down. When i did, i started listing, i heard loud growling, howls, and also something i have never heard before, something was hiting a tree with a bat, that is what it sounded like anyway. I had never heard these noises before, so i went back inside. i could not here nothing else when i was inside.

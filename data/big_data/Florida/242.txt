We were out shining deer in central Florida. It was about 2:00am and we hit a pair of eyes that appeared to be approx.7 to 8 ft. up. At approx. 150 ft. The eyes were at least 1 ft. apart! I thought at first it was a big owl but as we were pulling away we heard the most unbelievable scream. It scared my dad so bad that he stalled the truck trying to get out of there! As I look back on it that probably was not the proper response but things happen. We never went back to look for any signs but I have been back to the area since then and I believe that there is enough room to support at least a breeding pair of bigfoot/skunkape whatever it may be!

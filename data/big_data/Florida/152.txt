i SEEN A LARGE CREATURE WALKING THUR MY BACK YARD. ITS WAS SOMETIME AFETR KATRINIA, AND IT HAD BEEN REALLY DRY. THEIR ARE UNDERGROUND RIVERS AND ABOVE GROUND SPRINGS ON MY LAND. IT WAS SEPTEMBER THE 18, 2005, ABOUT 6;30 PM. I ONLY SAW IT FOR ABOUT I MINUTE AND IT LOOK TO BE  ABOUT 72 PLUS INCHES TALL, WITH A HAIRY BODY AND WALKED UPRIGHT. I HAD THE FUNNY FEELING IT WANTED ME TO SEE IT. IT WALKED VERY FAST AND SEEN TO HAVE APOINTED HEAD.

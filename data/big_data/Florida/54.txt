Monday July 10 2017 5:15AM. While driving home from an all night fishing trip at Tampa Bay, we were about 2 miles outside of Parrish FL. There was a car ahead of us & we were about 10 car lengths behind.This creature waited for the car ahead of us to pass and ran across between our two cars. It was running upright on two legs. It was huge & fast. It didn't have the shoulder motion that a human has when they run. Manatee Sheriff contacted.

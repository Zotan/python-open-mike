We were driving eastbound on US 41 to go fishing off of Turner River Rd. about 11 AM. at approx. 1/2 a mile east of the I 29 and US 41 intersection.  My girlfriend looked to the north side of the road and said "Jerry, I think I see something."  I looked immediately and saw the creature turn approx. 90 degrees take 3 steps and kneel straight down into the grass like a human would.  Judging by the height of the grass, we guessed it was about 8 feet tall and by the size of the torso it weighed probably around 400 pounds.  The creature was about 50 yards north of US 41.  The whole sighting lasted around 10 seconds considering we were driving around 60 mph.

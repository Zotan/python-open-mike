My family found a track of footprints on our hunting property. We were able to follow it for over a mile. We casted two prints (a right & left.)  We followed the track and found a place where it had gone through a barb wire fence, taking out 5 or 6 posts, and what appeared to be a place where it slept. We even found swamp cabbage that was eaten and appeared to be discarded.

My brother had built a hut (fort) in the woods right at the edge of the woods by our home. That morning, my little sister (age 5) and myself (age 9) went out to the hut. It was just after daybreak. The first thing we noticed was the smell. It was awful, very foul. We then heard something large walking through the woods. At this point,  I grabbed my sister and ran into the gully behind the hut to hide. After we were in the gully, we heard a growling sound. It would growl for a few minutes and then stop, and then growled one more time. Then we saw this huge thing standing at the edge of the woods. It was very tall, and broad. It was standing there on two legs with a human-like shape. It had hair that was brownish/red in color.This was not a bear. It was standing approximately 50 to 70 feet from us. The trees and bushes were obscurring it a small amount. It walked up to within a few feet of the hut, then turned and walked away. We were terrified. After it left, we ran home.

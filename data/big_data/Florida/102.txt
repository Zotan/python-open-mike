We were gonna go camping in the woods. It was a wooded area with a canal along one side that had a dirt pile next to it from digging out the canal. The dirt was high and very steep, almost straight upward. We were setting up the tents and I looked out into the open field that was about 100 yards away and saw a very tall, I'm not sure what to call it, thing running across the field. It stopped for about 30 secs and looked toward us and then ran straight up the dirt pile very fast to the top, stopped and looked again and ran away. This thing had no problem at all running up it. It was very tall, had long arms about to its knees. Had long brown hair all over it. It actually was very man-like but definitely not human I don't believe.

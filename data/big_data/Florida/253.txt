It was about 6:15 and I was walking to my bus stopand as soon as I got to the bus stop about 6:20 I heard loud howling and then about every 5 minutes I heard more howling. It was like something was yelling, or trying to yell something. Neighborhood dogs were going crazy. And some dogs ran into the woods and I heard rustling in the woods, and then got on the bus.

My daughter and i were camping at gore's landing a small camp ground near fort Mcoy fl, a very small camp ground with around 10 sites. At about 3am we both heard a long high pitched whoop that i've never heard before and i've lived and hunted in fl my whole life. I have never experienced anything like it, the way it made the hair on my neck stand up. I told my daughter it was nothing but needless to say i was awake the rest of the night. this was in 07 and i havn't thought much about it until last night i was watching Finding Bigfoot and BoBo made a call and the hair stood up again, it wasn't exactly like it but pretty close. Maybe someone can tell me what this was because the closest animal i can link it to is a Panther witch sounds like a woman screaming but this wasn't a panther.

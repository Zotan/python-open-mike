My brother and I observed a large, black-brown human-like form near a large tree that had a branch some 18 inches in diameter hanging over a dirtbike trail.  We heard grunting and movement in the bushes next to tree and then saw that particular branch snapped in 2 with ease at it's base.  Then whatever it was ran into the woods leaving a path of destruction, mostly small trees laying down.

lived all my life with the Tampa Area as home, still do. While on a boy-Scout campout with Troop 232 of the Good Luthern church on Dale Mabry hwy. in Tampa , at Murdoch area , the strangest smell and other non-visual clues were attributed to Sulpher Water. When out the second night, in the distance , during initiation , R. E. and I saw something really big , really quick moving ,and emitting a high pitched scream , almost a shreak . It was running into the woods on two legs, and moving very fast. It was after mid - night , we had been taken out from camp by the Troop as New to the Scouts.As cubscouts we were somewhat prepared. As Tampa Bay Westshore residents , we were little woodsmen already , and whatever that object was we chalked up to the bigger Scouts . The Troopmaster worked at the Budwiser Brewery , lived near Chamberlain We never returned to the 'Glades area to innitiate troops , nor to even camp.

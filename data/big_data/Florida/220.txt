I was riding my mountain bike in the forest. I had been climbing a while so I pulled off the trail to rest. That is when I looked down and seen these huge foot prints that appeared to be barefoot. I took pictures. I wear an 8 1/2 women. These look to be about a 17. It was also off the trail which made me think that was even odder. I did hear stomping noise out there which I believe were wild boar in the distance. There was a time later that I smelled something nasty. I never saw anything but those prints freaked me out a little bit.

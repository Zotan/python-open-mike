My family and I took a boat ride to the Shell Island Beach (it wasn't really an island, it eventually connected to the mainland).  When we anchored I got out  and proceeded into the forest farther in.  As I began to approach the forest I heard a high pitched scream that I mistook as a bird at first, I then saw a large brown mass moving to my right in the trees in front of me.  I saw it for no more than a second as I turned around an ran back to the beach.

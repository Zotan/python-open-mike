I was out in the everglades target shooting when I heard something making a lot of noise behind me while I was reloading. When I turned around I say a bipedal ape-like thing looking from behind a tree.  I glared at it for a few seconds and I started running off. It scared the **** out of me.  As I got to my car, I saw the thing running behind the trees away from me and then I left in a hurry.

I was in my car going south on ___ towards ________ to run errands on a bright sunny Saturday morning. I came around the last curve of the road where it straightens out towards ________. I looked down at the temperature on my car and it said 86 and I saw a blue SUV coming towards me in the other lane. I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed. It was completely covered in thick hair, all the way to the pavement. I couldn't see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn't see any facial features. The head did not bob up and down as it walked. It just went straight across the road. I have never seen anything move so quickly. I've seen lots of animals cross the road in that general vicinity because there are not many houses or much development, and I have NEVER seen that. I did not believe in Bigfoot and teased my husband because he believed. I will never doubt another sighting report. The hair of the chest was slightly orange in the bright sunshine. It moved so fast I was unable to see it's face but I saw the right arm swing back and the left arm swing back and then it stepped out of view. I kept driving towards it and the SUV and I thought I might flag that SUV down and ask if they saw it but when it got close to me, but decided not to. The hair kind of stood up above the head. I would say it had a sort of flat forehead and kind of a pointy head. The hair seemed to be standing above it's head but there wasn't any wind. I would be happy to show some BFRO person exactly where this happened and explain it to them if someone wants to contact me or come here for a visit.

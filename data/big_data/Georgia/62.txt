I had two squatches approach me after I had shot a deer in 2013. They didn't come into view but I wasn't trying to see as I was trying to field dress my deer and leave the area. They were yelling back and forth making sounds I haven't heard in the woods in 35 yrs. They sound like a mix of a bull, a bull elk and a lion. No animal makes sounds like that in Georgia. I had also found many fresh tree breaks on my way to my stand site the day before.

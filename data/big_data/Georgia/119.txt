This past wednesday night I was watching TV in my game room above the garage. It was around twelve or twelve thirty when it sounded like something hit one of the garage doors. I waited about five seconds before I looked out the window because it freaked me out a little. I then looked out the window to see a large thing, well over six feet tall, covered in hair right below the window. The hair was almost dread like, it was long and matted. When I saw it it was already heading back into the woods. It was gone within two seconds.

I was traveling in my vehicle coming across a bridge with a well known river passing underneath, when I noticed a large tree that had fallen into the water off to the right about 200 yards. As I looked at it, I peered up over the concrete railing and saw something standing in the river perhaps 75 yards away. My first thought was 'well, there's a bear'. But as I kept looking, it was apparent to me that it did not have a snout of any sort. It's face was like a human face, but black. This creature seemed to be in the middle of something (fishing?) and I had either spooked it or interrupted it. As I looked at it, it was looking at me and following my vehicle with it's gaze. It was black and it had long hair, like a shaggy dog. Trying to remember now, but I don't believe it had a neck of any sort that I could see.I corrected myself, before veering over too far and rubbing against the railing. I kept driving. It never occurred to me until later that what I saw was a Bigfoot. Am very familiar with Bigfoot and thought if I ever saw one it would be walking away or from a distance, and be a unique experience to remember for a lifetime, but it was nothing like this. And to be honest with you, it was an intimidating experience and I have not been back to that area since.

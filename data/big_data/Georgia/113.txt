My father had been outside working on the back deck, when he heard, what he calls a "squal" or scream coming from the same direction as the howl that was reported earlier this month.  The dogs in the area responded in the same manner as before of barking and howling in response.  I had asked my parents to let me know if there were any further occurences.

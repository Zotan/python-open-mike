I was driving to work Friday, May 10. I twas approximately 6:15 EST. I had just cut off Hwy 278 at the Shilo Church road and had gone approximately 1 mile. It was light enough that I could see into fields, I was looking for deer which is my hobby while driving. The first field that I came to I began to scan it. There was something standing in the field about 30 yards from the road. It was around 8' tall. I could see the body and head, with the body extending down into the grass which is about 3' tall. By the time I stopped my truck, the figure was no longer there. As you approach the filed it is around a slight curve in the road and about 60 yards to where I made the sighting.

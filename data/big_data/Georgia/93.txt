it was 8:30 am me and jody was going fishing and when we got there a camper was there and a few people so he got out and was talking to them and i went to the side of the pond where trees where in the water to bass fish i was there about 10 minutes when the hair on my neck stood up i looked around but didnt see any thing so i went back to fishing and i could feel someone watching me so i turned around and at the top of the bank behind me i saw it standing there watching me its hair was reddish brown the top of its leg was about the size of my chest and im 44 inches in the chest it was the biggest thing i ever saw id say between 9 to 10 feet tall as i was looking up its body it turned and started to walk away i never got to its face to see it but the size was breath taking i froze in my tracks i couldnt yell i couldnt move i was just there and on a 12 foot back it was just standing there it never made a sound i dont know if it was there when i walk up to fish or if it come up on me but i never heard any noise

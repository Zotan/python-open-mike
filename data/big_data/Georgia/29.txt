IT WAS AROUND 930 OR 10 AT NIGHT. ME AND MY GRANDPA WERE GOING HOME. WE HAD BEEN AT A FRIENDS THAT DAY. WE CAME DOWN CANTON RD PAST TATE, AND THEIR WAS HARDLY ANY TRAFFIC. WE CAME DOWN A HILL CLOSE TO A SUBDIVISION, AND A TALL MUD RED CREATURE WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US. WE DIDNT THINK IT WAS A JOKE CAUSE WHEN IT STEPPED OFF THE ROAD IT WAS HOLDING ON TO THE VERY TOP OF A ROAD SIGN.

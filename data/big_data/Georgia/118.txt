Ok well where to start my names XXXXX founder of a local paranormal group in Calhoun GA. The first time I had something happen it was just a normal night of investigating and about 20 mins into our night we heard something that changed my views on bigfoot forever and I'm now out every weekend bigfoot hunting. I've had many strange things happen to me at this spot from rocks being thrown, howls that I have on audio, wood knocks and I have seen 3 over the last year of visits to the cemetery.

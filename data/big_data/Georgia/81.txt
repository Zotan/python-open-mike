On the recommendation of Mr, Pruitt and Mr. Morris i tried some tree knocking . I took my 15 year-old daughter because she thinks all of this is nonsense what better than a bias opinion i thought. well i got several responses. Something in the woods tonight knocked back. Upon the first three in return my daughter about jumped out of her shoes.

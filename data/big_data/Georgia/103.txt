It was one of those nights where I couldn't sleep, so I decided to ride around to look for deer. I observed a large, upright form, dark gray in appearance on two legs cross the road in front of me. Its stride was long, he covered a country two lane road approximately 18 feet in width with probably 3 steps. I remember thinking " Man!, that was quick". He crossed the road in no time.

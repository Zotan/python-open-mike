My mother one night heard a whistle sound about 2am. So we went out to see if somebody was out back. We had a pool deck that was a good 8ft. off the ground. When I stepped up on the step something came toward me so I back up to the front door and shined the flash light out back and it was a good 2ft above the deck with red eyes. It kept movin its head around tryin to get the light out of its eyes. Then it start walking away it would turn and kept looking back a us. When it moved behind my neighbor shed it stop and stick its head out from behind the shed. It was like it was seeing if we was going to follow it.

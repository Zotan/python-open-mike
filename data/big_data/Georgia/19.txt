Hi me and my friend have been hearing some weird stuff while we are hunting. My friend heard the sonds first. Then I heard them the next evening right before dark. The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand. The reason I think it is a bigfoot is because there is some property behind ours, and they have been clearcuting all of it. I think it has run the bigfoot on to our property. If I see or hear any thing else I will send you more info, but from what I have already heard I think it is a bigfoot.

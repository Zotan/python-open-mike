I was coming home from work, turning off a major 4 lane hiway.  After aproximately 1/4 mile, near a new subdivision, I saw something moving very fast, as it ran across the hiway in front of my car. It appeared to be 8 to 10 feet tall, with reddish-brown looking hair. It didn't look at me, but I noticed long hair from its arms, legs and also shoulders. It moved across the road, it appeared, in 4 to 5 strides running.

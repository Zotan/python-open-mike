The subject that my brother saw was between 8-9 ft tall.  It had brown hair covering its body, appeared to have no neck, very long arms, took long strides. It was started to cross a road when he came up on it.  It never moved any faster, just glanced sideways at the car, and kept walking till it crossed the road into the woods. he determined the height of it by comparing it to a road sign on the side of the road.

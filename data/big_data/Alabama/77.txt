I'm really not sure what I saw. I was going back to Birmingham  on interstate 59 exit 166 as I was going down the ramp to get on the interstate this is what I saw I cought something out of the corner of my eye and thought is was an owl but then I releaized that there was no branch there and when this thing looked at me I remember seeing to huge eyes  and it looked like it had it's arm leaning on a tree it was about 6 to 8 feet high and a dark color sort of a grey black blended in with the trees.  I just cought it for a few seconds.. I'm just not sure, I just know it was not an owl..

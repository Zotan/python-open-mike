Me and my best friend were riding down a dirt road right past the oil well rd. we seen a roughly 7' tall big "something" in the road just as our headlights hit it it threw something down and jumped into the woods. we stopped to examine what it was and found it to be a half eaten rabbit. the rabbit was like you had sheared it off with a knife. i saw no foot prints, but i did notice a strange musky odor in the air.

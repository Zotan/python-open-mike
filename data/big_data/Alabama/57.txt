2nd 2013 Oct.. I was fishing and I heard what was two bigfoots fighting and when i shined my spotlight across the creek, two large brown hairy looking caveman looking things ran swiftly up the hill and i reeled in my poles and got the hell out of there. I'm not going back there at all by myself again.

Was driving home at night about 9:00 pm. Turned on Bone Camp road from highway 171 and saw a large figure standing in the brush. As I turned on my brights it had taken off in the brush. This is the second time I've seen this thing and a friend of mine who lives on Bone Camp has also seen it as well as finding strange tree formations and randomly snapped limbs.

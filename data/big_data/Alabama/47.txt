I was probably 13 or 14 at the time.  I was riding my bicycle down a wooded trail in a relatively populated part of town.  A bigfoot jumped out in front of me, I fell off my bike and he stood over me, and howled/growled not  feet away from me. He then turned and ran through the woods away from me.  He was between 7 and 8 feet tall more on the skinny side but still big. Not groomed kind of mangy looking.  Longer than average arms and thick through the shoulders to the top of the neck.  I know what I saw.  I'm 42 now and have been called crazy all my life because I openly admit what I saw.  The sound it made could not be recreated by a person.

A large creature, about 6.5 feet tall and covered with hair, crossed the road in front of me in broad daylight at about 3 PM. The creature crossed the road just below the top of the hill and moved in a sideways fashion. I had the window down in my car and I clearly heard a scream unlike any I have heard before in my life.

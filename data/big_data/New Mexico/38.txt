I was hunting in the Chuska Mountains (unit [withheld] of the Navajo Nation).  I heard wood knocks, just two clear knocks towards the north of my tent. The previous night i had heard foot steps coming towards my tent.  The other campers were south and southeast of my area 10 to 20 yards away.  I was already in my tent ready to sleep.

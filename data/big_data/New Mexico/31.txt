while camping protecting other equipment before a feats was starting. Early in the morning heard several screems from one of the canyon, we where camping at the entrance to two canyons. the screems where high pitch and whooping frist set of screems where about two min. long the secound was about min. i got up early and asked my nephew if heard the screeming he stated he heard it from up the canyon. i know the diffrence between a coyote, cougar, or bobcat screem it sounded nothing like it, it sounded more like the recorded screems, recorded by others over the net.

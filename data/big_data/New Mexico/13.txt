I was driving at night on I-25 on raton pass.  This happened last night.  It was late and then I noticed something on the side of the road.  I thought it was a bear or something.  Then it took of and ran across the road behind my car.  I was so surprised and shocked I did not stop.  It was about 6 ft plus and it crossed the road in three steps or so.

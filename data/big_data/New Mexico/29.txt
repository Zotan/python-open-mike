I was in gubnerdor nm rio areba co. it was about 6:30 p.m. and i was in a oil field on blm land. im a water hauler and was heading out to the hiway and got stuck in a ditch. it was at this time that i saw it. i was sitting there and was looking around when i felt it starring at me .. i turned and looked out my drivers side windo and he was looking at me. he was about 3 to 6 feet away and it was dark and had just rained . i looked at him and turned on my side work lights and he put up his hands to block the light from his eyes and thats when i got a real good look at him .. he was about 7 or 8 foot tall and very musculer build hie hands where like a humon hand but bigger and his face was that of a gurillas but little more human and his hair was long and dark brown after a few seconds he let out a scream and turned around and ran off with very long strides and very smoth gat .. that was the 2nd. time i saw it out there and a friend saw it a time ot two .

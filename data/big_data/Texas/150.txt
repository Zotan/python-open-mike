My sister and our friend were picking up coke bottles for cash to buy gas for my sister's volkswagon.  She was driving while our friend and I walked along side.  We heard this extremely loud roar like scream that we had never heard before. We were country kids who grew up in the country and knew all the animals in the area & heard every sound they all make except for this one.  It was so loud you could feel it in your stomach.  My friend went in the window, I flew in through the sun-roof shouting for my sister to take off.  About 300 yards up the hill we looked back & there stood in the middle of the road an extremely tall, brownish-red hair covered creature, standing on two feet like a man.  It had walked out of the shade & was standing in the evening sun.  You could tell that it had the body of a large man except this reddish brown hair covered it's body.  His arms were down to it's side and appeared longer than ours.  Area now has been developed. Never seen it since, not that we ever went looking for it.  Would love to see it again though.

I was hunting in Reklaw in the Angelina river bottom. I was in a pasture with a .243 and a high power scope. It was about 45 minutes till dark and my feeder just went off there were some doe out to the right of the feeder about 100yards. I was watching them then out of the corner of my eyes I seen something walking on 2 feet I pulled my rifle up to look through the scope and seen it was big and brown. It had hair all over it, it was like nothing I have ever seen. It came out of some woods in the neighbors pasture and was walking towards me. It was about 7 feet tall and it looked to be about 500lbs it disappeared into the woods to the left of my neighbors pasture and I didn't see it again I know the people that hunt over there and they are all around 6 foot and no where as big as this was.

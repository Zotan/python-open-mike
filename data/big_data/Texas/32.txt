I was driving home it was about 3 in the morning .Just turned off hwy 64 on to FM 279.  I always drive below speed limit because of deer as I was driving over a bridge  on 279 entering Vanzandt county had my bright lights on to the right saw this big hairy thing carrying a deer it kind of scared me never saw nothing like that I just took off.

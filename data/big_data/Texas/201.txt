My 5 year old granddaughter was riding her toy 4 wheeler in our backyard while my wife was sitting reading. She rode to my wife and told her to come see and hurry, my wife walked as fast as she could but by the time she got there whatever it was was gone. When we asked what she saw she described something tall and hairy that was watching her. She said it was brown with hair like grass, taller than her father but, she didn't see any eyes. It had hair that stood up on top of its head. She swears it was not a cow in the pasture next door.

While hunting in east Texas I saw a large hair covered, 7 ft tall, 275 lb. something ape/man like creature vault/leap over a fence, land on 2 legs and step off the trail into the forest. Through the 9 power rifle scope it looked exactly like some of the sketches I have seen. This occured 25 years ago and I just now started looking into other peoples sighting.

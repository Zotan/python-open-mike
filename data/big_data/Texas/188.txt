One night around 11:30-12:00 me and my boyfriend and his cousin were out in a pasture at my boyfriends grandpas land just sitting around talking and his cousin looked over and saw a very large figure was walking toward us. She told us to look and it was over 7 feet tall because my boy friend is 6'5 it had long arms and very bulkey. it stood there looking at us and as we stood up it crouched down.I ran to my car and his cousin jumped in the back seat and I climbed over the passenger seat into the drivers seat and turned on the lights and it was gone by the time I had turned on the light so my boyfriend got into the car and we left and never went back at night.

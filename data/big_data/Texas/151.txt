I and my family live on the north side of Ennis on I-45. At the time, I was 13 yrs old. I was at home with my brother's girlfriend. We were there alone. She was giving me a tattoo on my left arm of a cross. We were sitting at the dining room table. I was looking out the dining room window, looking at the gas station behind my house. Then we heard something at the little kitchen window. We thought it was my brother playing a trick on us, so we got up to see if it was him. But we didn't see anything, so we went back to the table. When I went to look out the window again, there was someone standing at the window. I thought it was my brother so I got up and showed my arm to it, thinking it was my brother. Well then it stood up. Then I went to the window thinking my brother was standing on something. Why I say that is because the bottom of the window was 4 and a half feet from the ground and my brother is 5 foot 11 inches tall. So I looked out the window, and it looked at me. I was about 6 inches from its face. I saw its eyes then.

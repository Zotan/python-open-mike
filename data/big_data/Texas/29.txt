2016-2017 Grand Prairie Texas. Buildings are going up and new construction is on the rise. With that said, the sighting, as well as sounds heard on different nights, have been observed. The area of activity is only about 5 acres because of all the new construction and includes woods, a pond, and a large stick bed and shelter. The sighting was in the evening during sun down while on a walk with my wife. It was as still as it could be looking into the woods/treeline. As I sit on my patio at night I can hear wood knocks and one time heard what I thought to be a woman's voice call/tone.

I was duck hunting in waders at Lake Cherokee. After hunting that day, I was exiting the water onto the shore and looked to my right about 200 - 300 feet. I had that creepy feeling that I was not alone. I thought to myself that it was just a big tree stump, but it moved. I saw a large creature that was fairly tall and dark. It looked at me. It appeared to be hairy. I could clearly make out that it was not another hunter. It had hair on it - kinda long and dark. We looked at each other for what must have been 20 minutes. I think it had been looking at me before I noticed it. I could not make out any facial features. Finally, what I saw turned and started walking away from me. I stood there watching it walk along the banks of the lake. After it was pretty far away I headed back to my truck. At the back of Lake Cherokee where I was hunting there were no houses or structures back then (in 1980). I haven't been there in over 15 years. I didn't hunt at that location for quite some time. When I did, I took someone else with me. It really spooked me. I have never gone on record with this for fear of being labeled a nut.

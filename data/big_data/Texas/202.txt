I was climbing down with my climbing deer stand when the strangest howl came from directly behind me. I grew up in a swamp I know what all the night animals sound like. This was blood curdling. I have heard it before and did not see a deer there the rest of the year. I quit hunting that marsh this year after that howl. I did not have a deer picture since 11-23-14 in that area.

It was about 8:pm , it had been an Indian summer type day and I had taken my horse for a long ride one saturday afternoon , I lost track of time and I was late getting back from my ride, this horse was a wellbroke animal and as I came down a dirt road where there was a plank bridge the horse started to prance, snort and blow and he was watching something off to my left, I have excellent night vision and started trying to see what was spooking the horse. This horse had a long mane and I noticed it standing part way out like it was charged by static electricity, and the hair on my arms and back of my neck were standing up too. There was a full moon coming up that night and about a 10 mile an hour wind from the north blowing against my back. as I got over the bridge on the horse I could see in an opening in a meadow two large creatures standing erect and side by side watching me on the horse.They appeared too be swaying back and forth like they were trying to scent what was coming down the road. One looked to be about 7-8 ft tall and the other 6-7ft tall.I started to get scared even though they were on the other side of a barbed wire fence and about 35yards from the horse and me. I kicked the horse into a gallop and headed home my heart pounding in my chest. I looked back over my shoulder and saw them disappear slowly still walking erect into the woods.

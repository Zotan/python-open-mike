Approx. 3:40am, Dec. 20, 2017 went outside before work. Across from my house is all country, Corps of Engineer land, north end of Grapevine Lake, Denton County, Texas. Across the road of my house maybe 200 ft, I heard three loud knocks followed by a single one. A few seconds later, I heard something answer back with three knocks about a half mile away deeper in the woods.....tree knocks. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. It was dead quiet before all of this. I do know there were no kids in the woods, nor did I see any flashlights.

On a summer morning in 1972, can't remember what month.Me and my brother were sleeping and I noticed by our window where we slept a shadow.It was a big head pointing upward,I told my brother not too move.It stood there for about five minutes like it was looking for something.A day later we went behind the house where we saw this thing the only thing we saw was a set of tacks leading towards the house's.

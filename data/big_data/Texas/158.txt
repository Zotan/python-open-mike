We were sitting at a picnic bench when I saw three creatures. They were different sizes. I told my friend to turn around and he saw them also. They were standing in the trees up against the lake. We were at the Hagerman picnic area. In this same area, I heard pigs screaming terribly. Followed by a loud roar.

On Saturday, August 15, 2015 @ about 8:20 PM (Right before it got dark at about 8:30ish.), my family and I were driving home along I-70 South towards Pittsburgh. We had just passed the Grove City Outlets exit, about one or two miles, when I glanced to my left across the road and saw a Bigfoot walking back into the woods from the roadside brush.

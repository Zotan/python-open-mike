2071,0,"I would rather not have exact location (listing the nearest road) to repect the privacy of the family that still owns the property. I have long since had a falling out with my friend at the time and don't feel he or they would like being approache about this. I like my own privacy respected; so I must accord others the same. The general area at that time was more open farmland with some large housing developements (in which I lived) within a mile. There were a good deal of homes scattered here and there and others in smaller developments. A very large animal like a Sasquatch could conceivably navigate (migrate) through an area like this at night using farmland as cover; but absolutely not stay very long in an area like that even then without revealing it's presense. I can give you more specific details on topography. Farmland opens up eventually much more to the north with a State Park (Gifford Pinchot) at the north end of the county. Southern end of York county where the  sightings occurred is a more likely area given in terms of what I've read of similar topography of other sighting then.

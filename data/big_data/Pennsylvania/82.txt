I was sitting on my deck having a cold one and I heard the loudest howl, similar to one of the howler monkeys, but the strength of this howl was absolutly phenomenal. As I said before the strength and duration was hard for me fathom.  There were two of these great howls and they were moving south and away from my house which sits around 1,400ft above sea level. I, myself, can create a loud and powerful scream, but I had nothing on what I heard that June evening. There is no way it could have been a cougar or a bear. I've fished and camped for some 20 odd years and have never experienced the power of this howl that I heard in June 1997.

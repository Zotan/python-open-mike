Four 22 inch long bare human tracks. Eight feet from toe to heel in order left right left right. These tracks followed a deer path doun a hill and crossed a dirt road. The road was very hard and the tracks on the hill sunk in the earth about 2to 3 inches. The tracks on the road did not indent becouse of the hardness of the road. Dirt was left on the road in a bare foot form with 5 toes.

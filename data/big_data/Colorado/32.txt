1.) October 1996 after the second or third snow of the season. 2.) July 1997. 1.) Huge footprints with a couple inches of snow over them. But the stride was masive and could not be duplicated by myself, and was not elk or dear tracks. 2.) Loud crashing noise as if someone was mad at my presence. Sounding like something had broke a large branch in half. And then when I turned in the direction of the noise there was silence. As if some thing was now hiding. An animal such as an elk would be on the move. But what ever had made the noise was now, what seemed to be, hiding from my sight. It seems like there would be more in this area because of the size of the surrounding forest lands. I would love to hear more from this area.

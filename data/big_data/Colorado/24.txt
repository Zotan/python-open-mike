Resort manager and her friend were just completing their evening hike when they saw a "greyish" animal running past them at a speed so fast that at first they couldn't imagine what it would be.  It was standing up-right while running and was "huge".  I asked them to estimate its height but they didn't know other than it seemed to be a lot taller than them.  Probably at least 7' tall. They described it as "human looking".  I will encourage them to post the details themselves in the morning.

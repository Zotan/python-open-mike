My wife and myself and another couple were traveling west on I-70 roughly the 135 mile marker. The Colorado River is very visible to your left side only 50 yards away. The temperature was 10 degrees. It was about 5 pm, still plenty of daylight. We were all enjoying viewing the Colorado River when we all four noticed something tall thin and hairy walking in the middle of the river. It was slightly leaning forward and its arms were swinging. We just saw it for a few seconds, as we were traveling at highway speeds. We commented to each other that as strange as it seems it was a bigfoot.

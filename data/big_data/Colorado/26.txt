Oh my God is all that we can say. It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3:30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldnâ€™t move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6:15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this. This needs to be investigated please.

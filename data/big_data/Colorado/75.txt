I was driving down the highway in a tractor-trailer rig about 3:30a.m.I was driving about 65 mph.I went around a corner and on the left side of the road I saw something that at first I thought was a deer.This thing than stood upright and seemed to be more than 7 feet tall.I was able to look at it for just a moment as I was driving by.It had wide shoulders and an ape-like face.It's eyes were yellow like a cat's eyes when you shine a light on them.It just kind of looked at me when I went by.I wasn't able to see anything else.

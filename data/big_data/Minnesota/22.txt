While driving east on hwy 169 (approximately 3 miles out of Virginia, MN.), I saw, looking across 169 heading west to Hibbing, what appeared to be a large, silvery-gray creature in a clearing, just beginning to enter a wooded area.  I caught this movement from my peripheral vision from my left (so it was on the other side of 169) where there was a car pulled over on the opposite side apparently watching what I was seeing.  Because I was headed to Virginia and there were trees that popped up in the median as I was driving, I only observed this "something" for about 3 seconds or so.  It did have a peculiar way that it's arms moved when I saw it walking, and it had a cone-shaped head. After that, the wooded area in the median obscured my vision, but if I would have found a place to make a quick u-turn, I would have turned around to go back and investigate.  I sort of talked my self out of believing what I saw because this "something" was not the normal brownish/red color typified of a bigfoot sighting.  Perhaps it was one of those new-fangled netting out-fits hunters wear.  All I know is I saw something.

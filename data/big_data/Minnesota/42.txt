This is a second hand report.  Our daughter and her friend, a neighbor, were about ten years old and it was approximately 1988.  The two were walking into the woods off a trail near our home and saw a huge beige gorilla like creature.  The minute they saw it they were so scared they ran home.  Our daughter said there was no way this was a costumed person or another animal.  It was a tall two legged creature covered with beige colored hair. The two girls reported this incident to me almost immediately after it happened.  There was snow on the ground and they were wearing boots. I wanted them to show me the clearing where the creature was standing so I could look for footprints.  They said they would not go back there, they were too frightened.  On the way to tell me they saw another neighbor in her yard and told her but she did not believe them.  In the years since their sighting I have not thought much about it.  However, after reading websites on Bigfoot I really feel we have had Bigfoot living in the woods here.  It is not a really large area, but hard to get around in due to the marshy conditions around the small lake.

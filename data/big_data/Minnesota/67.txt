My friend and I had a job feeding sled dogs up in Isabella, MN. One night we were out pulling the blocks of meat out of a large walk in freezer (like in restaurants). While we were in the freezer the door slammed shut on us (which was extremely weird  as the door was very heavy, up on a 3 foot platform, and angled so it would hang open rather than close). We were both very shaken up as we opened the door.  We had a flashlight with and we shined it up towards  the trailer, I saw two eyes big as golf balls about 7 feet up shining back at me. When I looked over at my friend I could tell by the look on his face that he had seen the same thing. We went into the feed shed for another flashlight, and when we came back the thing had disappeared.

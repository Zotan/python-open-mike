i was driving north on Hwy 73 past west Olson road.  There is a recent clear cut on the north side of the road.  I seen a large brown animal sitting on the north side of the road in the grassy area of the ditch. I got within about 120 yds or so from the animal and it stood up and took 3 steps to cross the road heading south into the swampy area on the other side of the road.  I stopped the vehicle and you could see the grass on the north side patted down where something had been.  The animal was brown in color and when standing I estimate about 7 to 8 ft tall.

Swift is only about six miles from Warroad. Two individuals heading west seen a creature heading east on the right hand side, running and bobbing in and out of the ditch (swift ditch) Lakeside. They slowed down to try to get a better look and could not identify what they saw. They knew it was not a bear or a human. These individuals can identify all the creatures that are native to this area just glancing at them, but what they saw was not familiar to them.

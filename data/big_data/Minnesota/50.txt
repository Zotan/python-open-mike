No noise or odors, this dark figure turned and looked at my son who looked at it for 4 to 5 seconds and then ran back to his mother to tell her what had happened. He looked back after telling his mother and this creature was gone. The first thing my son said to me was its face was grayish brown no hair, but the rest of its body was covered with black hair.

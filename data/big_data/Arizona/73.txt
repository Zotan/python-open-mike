One night while driving near a canal, down a road near South Mountain Park in Phoenix, my friend and I saw a large black creature with a burly body walking on all fours or dragging it's front limbs like an ape cross the road in front of us. It looked at us with a face similar to a Sasquatch or orangutan and then was lost in the darkness. I was driving a Volkswagen bug and it was as large as my car.

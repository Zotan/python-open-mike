I was walking my dog and I went to the end of Mcneil road here in Show Low AZ. I went down into a ravine thaen back up to the main mesa behind the city park. I came around a bend on a trail and Billy growled and pulled to the left. I saw some motion out of the edge of my eye. I saw something tanny colored with a red tint. For all of 2 seconds I thought it was an elk or dear. I have came up on them before and they aren't as quiet as people think. It left way too quiet. I was very freaked out

I  was  playing  near  a  creek  on  a  elevated  point.I  happened  to  glance  up  into  a  thicket  about  30  yards away.there  was  a  creature  about  as  tall  as  a  small  tree  beside  it.I  guess  the  tree  was  around  8  foot.It  was  a  muscular  shape  with  brownish  grayish  colored  hair.Surprisingly  the  feet  were  not  as  large  as  you  would  think.But  yet  they  were  still  larger  than  a  average  human  being.He  turned  around  began  to  walk  towards  the  creek  above  the  hill.In  fright  I  ran  away.Never  saw  it  again

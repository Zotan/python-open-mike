The sighting was thru the window from the inside of the house. The creature was looking thru the living room window right above the halfway point. Which a person can't see past the bottom ledge.That is what scared me. It was moonlit and created a shadow. I had just turned off the TV at that time. We have alot of deer but they are not vertical or that tall. The incident lasted three seconds.

i just started working as a police officer, and i was assigned the midnight shift. i was doing my basic patrols, when i was runing low on gas. the officer who was working the evening had the gas card with him and he lived approx. 7 miles south of wanblee on a gravel road. i did speak to him over the phone and he said that he'll be waiting for me to come get it. i drove out to his residence and i did get the card and i started driving back into wanblee. as i was coming over a hill (the ditch area is approx.4-5 feet deep, on both sides of the gravel road) my patrol unit was a chevy tahoe, which did sit kind of high to the ground. i was north-bound when i started to descend the hill i noticed some thing "bobbing" in the ditch (west side of the road) and i was kinda high off the ground. i thought it was a bat or a bird, so i did'nt think nothing of it. the next minute, i did saw something run across the road, right in front of me. it was running towards the east.  i did see what i think was the shoulder area to the thigh area, through the windshield. i had a side view of this thing. i could still remember seeing the reddish-brown hair which covered the thing. the hair looked to be approx. 4-5 inches in length. and the overall torso/body from what i could see, was slim. from the chest to the arms. the arms were long and slim, i do not remember seeing the hands. it only happened for a brief second or so, but what ever it was.....was very fast. i did stop and turn around to try to see what it was , but it was gone

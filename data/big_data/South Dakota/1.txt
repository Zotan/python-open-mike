I was driving home to Custer,SD from Keystone,SD on Highway 244 or known as the  Mt. Rushmore Rd. At about 5:20 in the evening along the side of the road was a large bigfoot.I  looked right at him as I drove by . It was Reddish brown in color ,hairy,very tall, with long big arms and slightly hunched over. I drove by at about 40 mph and when I looked in the rear mirror it was gone. Later the next day I went back to the spot to look again and found nothing but a well used trail; I didnt go up the trail . It was about 1mile west of horsetheif lake.

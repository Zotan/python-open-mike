In 1996 or 97 we were spotlighting for deer. When i turned the light on there were two very big objects in the field. both were black with red eyes. watched them for aprox.3 to 5 minutes.They didnt move only blinked.Suddenly got a wierd feeling turned the light around didnt see anything shined back they hadnt moved. Felt like it was time to go. There were no deer in field which was very unusual.

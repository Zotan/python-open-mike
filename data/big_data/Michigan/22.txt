While hunting in the Pinckney State Recreation Area during the last week of deer season my hunting partner and I heard loud whooping or howlling type noises similar to those heard in recordings on this site along with bi-pedal type foot steps through heavy brush. The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.  I have continued to hunt the area since then and have had no further incident. .

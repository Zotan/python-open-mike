I was getting ready to take a bath and I saw a huge shaggy typical bigfoot looking thing standing outside the bathroom window. It was very shaggy and very tall. It's head and shoulders blocked most of the window which was about 6 feet off the ground. I was so scared I removed the window and plastered over the spot.

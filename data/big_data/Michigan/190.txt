I was coming home from hunting and I looked down the side of a field.  I then seen a big, black thing walking down the side of the field and I went back to check it out.  The creature seemed to be afraid of me as it jumped in the weeds leaving only its legs exposed.  I then got my binoculars out and seen that its legs were hairy.  The creature seemed too big for a human being or a bear.

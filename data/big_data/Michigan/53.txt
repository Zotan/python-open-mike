I have lived in Montcalm county Michigan my whole life on Church rd in Vestaburg I have had many strange experiences here in my home woods I could tell many different stories but i want to tell my most recent one on or about Oct 28th. I heard some strange growls and grunting noises, it was a clear night and bright outside. Around 2am i went out with my surefire flashlight and went to the woodline by my side yard and right away smelled a strong almost dead animal smell. I heard brush cracking across my road, I shined my light and seen a set of bright green large eyes. I watched a tall dark brown bipedal creature around 7ft tall cross my road to my side and enter my woods. I backed away as I was a little nervous I went back in my house and heard noises all night. Now i have had other experiences with this creature it has a flat face that is close to a human face for the last ten years. I have known it is here, I think it uses my woods as a travel corridor.

Large figure squatting off my back deck possibly looking in the windows. I chased it into the woods and lost it, first I thought it was a person but when coming back out of the woods I noticed the shed it ran by. His head was over the shed when it ran by it. I didn't come close and I stand 6' 2", it put chills down my spine so bad we moved.

(Early fall in western Michigan) Around midnight I was in bed watching TV. I heard these "howls" over the TV through closed windows. I turned down the TV and listened closer. These sounds where nothing I recall ever hearing. I have spent MUCH time in the woods night and day. NOTHING was like this. The "howls" were followed by what I can only describe as ape like grunts. My horse in the back yard was nervous as hell and I could hear dogs barking in several distant locations. I woke my wife and she heard VERY similar sounds in early spring. These sounds where NOT Coyotes or wolves or wild hogs or an owl or a bear. Heard all those in the woods throughout my life. We got on-line and looked up "bigfoot" recordings for Michigan and other states. Some where VERY similar to what we heard.

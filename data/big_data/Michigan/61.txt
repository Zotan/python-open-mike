While sitting around the bonfire listening to music and talking our family heard screams out in the distance. They sounded like a party that turned into chaos. At first we figured it was nothing but then after hearing Cliff scream on Finding Bigfoot we figured we heard a Bigfoot Up North so we thought we should report it.

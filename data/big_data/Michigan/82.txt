It was about 20 yrs ago. in Roscommon Mich. on M-18 just south of the town Roscommon at the sub power station. It happened at about 9pm at night in the fall. I had a friend with me that night and he saw it also. At the time we thought it was the dogman of Roscommon County. But of the the years I have been thinking about it and seeing your show and the people seeing them in Michigan I am now really believing it was a bigfoot. If this interests you let me know. Thanks

I'm 46 years old, we were at a migrant worker camp in Bear Lake Michigan picking apples. I stepped out of our house for what reason I can't remember. I happened to look in a direction up towards a hill and I seen something walking. And now reflecting on its body shape and height and the way it walked I know it wasn't human because this thing was at least 9 or 10 ft tall, if not bigger. I never told anyone, I was about 14 or 15 years old. I believe they exist.

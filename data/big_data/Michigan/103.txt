I was walking from the house to a detached garage with my daughter about 2:30 am when we both seen a (human like) white furry figure approx. 100 feet from where we were. Our house borders the Huron National Forest the figure was half way down a hill looking in our direction it moved very quickly in a half moon circle and crouched down near a tree. We walked toward the figure I noticed it was still near the tree bent over slightly almost like it was trying not to be noticed. We both ran back to the garage and talked about what we saw and decided we didn't know what it was mostly because of its size and the way it moved. When we got back to the garage we both said how hard our hearts were beating it was truly a scary experience. My daughters name is Madison we talked about it for a long time that night and tried to come up with an animal it could have been but could not. The next day I called my friend Jeff he has experience in this field we walked the area and seen a lot of deer activity and droppings it was thriving with wildlife.

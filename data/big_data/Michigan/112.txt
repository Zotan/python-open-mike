We were traveling home, from Kalkaska, about  dusk. When we came around a bend and our head lights hit an animals eyes glowing back, the driver being an avid hunter, backed up to inquire. A smaller than you normally hear of, lighter in color, Bigfoot was there. It, at first sight, was sitting with its leg crossed on a log. When our headlights hit it, it stood up startled, and strode into the woods.

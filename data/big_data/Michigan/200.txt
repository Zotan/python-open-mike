I was sitting outside on my patio this past summer.  It was midafternoon when I heard a sound in the woods behind our home that reminded of sounds that bigfoot researchers make on television shows when they are calling to see a bigfoot is in the area.  It really gave me goosebumps.  Last night around dusk I heard a screech from the opposite direction. Again, it was different than anything I have ever heard.

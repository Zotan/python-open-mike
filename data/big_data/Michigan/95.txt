I went out to check for deer tracks to see if the deer herd was growing. While checking the ground I found two sets of human-like foot prints twice the size of my size feet. The ground was hard and the footprints were coming out of the neighbors swamps trailing four to five deer from the north to the swamps in the south. I noted the size and direction they went. This was the first of twenty foot print encounters I had since then. My assumption is that they were tracking deer.

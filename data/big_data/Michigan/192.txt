last night i was sleeping with my g/f and we were awaken by screams it sounded like two ladies being killed and it came from two dif areas... my dog who was also sleeping with us was woken up by this and started going crazy. she was scared and also mad at what ever was screaming. the screams sounded like they were about 100 yrds or so from us maybe even closer. i didnt get up and use a flashlight to see what it was in the woods. my g/f was scared bad by this and i thought we would share this with you

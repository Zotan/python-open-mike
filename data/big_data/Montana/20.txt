During the night, horrible smells were noticed. The smells were shortly accompanied by strange, very loud "warbling" noises, which circled the cabin where 4 friends were spending the night. One person, my aunt, taped these sounds on a portable tape recorder. These sounds were never sent to be analyzed.

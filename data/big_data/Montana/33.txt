THE SUMMER OF 1994 A FRIEND AND I WERE CAMPED OUT LOOKING FOR GOLD. WE HAD A CLIAM AT THE TOP OF MADDISON GULCH NEAR LINCOLN, MT. I SAW ONE. MY PARTNER WAS DOWN BY THE CREEK AND DID NOT SEE THE BIG FOOT. I WAS CAUGHT OF GAURD. AND VERY SURPRISED. I KEPT BLINKING. I JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. IT WAS NOT A BEAR!! I HAD FELT AS IF I WAS BEEN WATCHED MOST OF THE DAY. IT WAS STANDING UPRIGHT AND DARK IN COLOR AND TALL,AND WALKED INTO THE TREES.IT DID NOT SEEM AFRAID.IF ANYTHING, I WOULD SAY IT SEEMED SURPRISED THAT I SAW IT. IT WAS ABOUT 100 FEET OR SO AWAY. THE NAME OF OUR CLAIM WAS GRANDBABIES MINING CO. MY PARTERNS NAME WAS CHARLES HASENBECK. HE IS DEAD NOW.

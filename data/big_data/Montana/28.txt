I did not directly see this incident.  I don't even know if this IS a sighting!  We were on our way to Alaska in 2003 and went via Glacier National Park.  I had a video camera that I was recording on and took more videos than photos.  Only months after we got back home and I got around to looking at the tapes, did I see this figure in the video.  I wish I had seen it while I was filming.

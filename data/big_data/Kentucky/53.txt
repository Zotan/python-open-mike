On June, 18, 2014 I set out to find where two creeks merge back in the woods. On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path. A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge. Left my casting material in the truck; therefore, decided to walk back after taking pics.  Sunday afternoon the 22nd and after a few days of rains went back a different way. While walking next to the woods in a corn field i heard something trailing me in the woods. Determined it was somewhat large with all the noise it was making breaking  branches and logs on the ground. Went past the location where the creeks merge and doubled back. Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field. The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there. A small print was on the back right side of the adults heal print about 2.5 to 3 inches long. Placed my backpack next to the print because no others around. The farmer had cultivated the field. Walked to the creeks and chased something into the creek. It was large by the sound of the splash, like a belly busted splash sound. It ran off and started making growls. It would do a growl  then a second later do another growl. Then a few seconds 5 to 10 seconds of silence then another set of two growls. Did this for eight sets of growls and then i did a whoop, after that whoop... silence - not another sound. Spent days looking for growls like what i heard and on Legends Beware a video taken on 12/July/2013 at the counter mark of .18 and especially 1.40 is the growl. I have been back and left peanut butter but no other tracks except a lot of deer tracks. Believe they may be from a area to the west that people have noticed years before, it was getting too populated for them. ?

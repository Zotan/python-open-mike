well it was really dark outside and i could not make a good visual of the creature but it was unlike anything i have ever seen before in my life.  If was about 8ft tall and i would say about 450 pounds.  it was walking like a human kinda but not exactly.  It was very hairy looking and was making some weird grunting noises.  Then when it saw me i about **** my pants i was so scared i thought about running but i was too scared to run so i stayed and then it left i was so relieved. There is such a thing as bigfoot i took pictures of his foot prints in the mud and i think that they should send researchers out here to look for it i believe that you will find it actually i promise you will find it.

A friend and I were camping close to the Kentucky/Virginia line in Harlan county Kentucky,we went to dig ginseng roots,we were camped below a cliff-line in deep woods and were asleep when we were awakened by howls and screams. The vocalizations started out like an owl sound, but became growls, that merged back into a howling at the end.Trees were shook and objects were thrown into our campsite. Small sapling trees were thrown, roots first, across our campsite.We would build up the fire and it would go away, but when the fire would die down it would return.This continued for hours until almost daybreak.We found sapling trees broken off and uprooted all around our camp. We tried to pull up a tree slightly smaller than the ones uprooted but both of us together couldn't pull one out of the ground.I would gladly submit to a polygraph test to prove my truthfulness.

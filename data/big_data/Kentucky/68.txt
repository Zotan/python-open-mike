I was standing in my front doorway changing a light bulb and I heard a popping/cracking sound that I had never heard before I looked down and both of my cats were running up the sidewalk to me maybe a minute after I looked up across the highway behind my mailbox and there was  something about 7 to 8 feet tall just walking by calm as could be. It was huge it's color was very light white/brown it's arms was at it's knees and I was not the only one who seen it that year our county sheriff seen it at his house as well I know the sheriff very well and I know he would not lie about somthing like this he tracked it for about a mile behind his house and found some of it's hair on his fence

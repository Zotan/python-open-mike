Hello my name  is **** and I have a story. I was walking home and I think I saw bigfoot. It was about 2:30 when I was walking down the road in Powell co.I had stop to rest,I heard a big splash in the river. I looked around and saw a big shape in the water.I at first thought it was a bear but it stood up it looked like it was fishing. I don't know how deep the water is but it looked like it was standing about four feet out of the water, and had long shaggy hair.

I was one of two teenage boys playing near coal mine noticed something standing right at the mouth of the mine. It appeared to be a gray or white looking ape type animal on two legs, with one arm hanging over a wooden cross timber, which would be about 8-9 feet tall. They ran to tell parents but when they got back it was gone. I was born in Cary and never saw anything like what I saw there that day with a neighbor boy. It was in the afternoon when the other boy and I was playing near a slate dump on the side of a hill, when we walked up the hill toward the mouth of the coal mine we both saw the same thing at the same time. The thing scared us to death . We looked at it several times it watched us and we watched it. Its arm moving back and forth across the wooden timber. No mistake what ever it was, was alive!!!!!! We may have been young but we both know what we saw , that day and I still remember like it happened yesterday.

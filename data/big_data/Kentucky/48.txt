We’ve had several noises occurring over the past month.  Some loggers just started cutting on the property next to us.  So I think has made them angry and it seems that they are mad at us.  We didn’t own the property. We are not people who want the trees cut down.  But here lately we’ve had knocking on trees, slapping the side of our house footsteps and growling right outside our house.  When I walked down my driveway I heard what sounded like a stick being hit against a tree trunk.  Heard running around my house late at night.

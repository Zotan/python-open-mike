I found a skull a few day's ago on my farm while hunting, I've showed to to everybody I know, and they say its an ape! No other bones where found. I live on a farm and being a hunter I find skulls & bones all the time, an this is nuthin like I've ever seen before!! We've seen things that we cant explain here! I would like to have some answers on whats going on!

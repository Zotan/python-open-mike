Possible vocalizations on the 1400 acre farm we manage. This happened in the fall of 2014. I was outside on the deck and was listening to the coyotes out back. They were quite loud. I heard a howl like I have never heard before. I heard it 2 more times and then quiet. I have been out in the woods for most of my life. I have hunted extensively and never heard anything like this.

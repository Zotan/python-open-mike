I and my friends were hiking at the eatonville waterfalls when we smelt a wet dog musky sweet smell. We figured it was elk or a bear. When we turned the corner by the middle fall there was a huge black creature crouching over like a human drinking from the river. My buddy gave a suprised yelp and it looked up stared at us for a minute then moved lightning quick into the trees.

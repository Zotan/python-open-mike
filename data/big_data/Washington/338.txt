My fiance and her son and I went to the Colville National Forest to have a picnic and to get away from the city. We've been there a couple of other times. Me and her son was walking some trails and we came to a dried up creek bed, we were looking for moose tracks and we seen these foot prints. They were about 4 to 5 inches wide and about 13 inches long, didn't get no pics I didn't have my phone with me, didn't think to take pics with the others phone .I was in awe then we went back to where we were parked and Sat there ate some sandwiches and did some tree knocks. No response did some calls it was still daylight then about 8:00 or 8:30 did a call and got an immediate response, and then did another call and then got a delayed response. This was on the 3rd of September 2017. We went back two weeks later to take pictures, foot prints were gone and looked like it rained.

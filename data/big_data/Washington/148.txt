I was hiking thru Colville National Forest with a group of 4 other individuals. we were all very spread apart and had encountered a field, the field was surrounded by woods with a lone tree in the middle to help explain the scenario, I will say we were heading North. I was the last person to walk through the field as I approached the tree in the center of the field I heard noise from the west side of the field. I hid behind the tree and started scanning the wood line and made eye contact with what at the time I had no idea what it was. It stood at what I would guess anywhere between 7-10 ft. in length it was well concealed by the woods so I couldn't get a clear shot of the body however the fur was of a dark brown/black color. Soon my fight or flight kicked in and I ran over to where my friends were waiting for me. As I took off whatever I was looking at charged, not at me but in some direction it was LOUD and had immense power it fell a tree. Once I arrived at my friends location they asked why I made so much noise, I explained the situation and convinced myself it was a bear. as an avid outdoorsman I have seen bears and that was definitely not a bear. It had to be Bigfoot.

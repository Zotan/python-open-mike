My girlfriend and I had been walking midday, 230-330ish, when we decided to walk down an overgrown old logging road. About a half mile down the road a meadow opened up on the left hand side and we decided to start walking through it. I had kind of started getting a bad feeling but attributed it to the fact that we were walking through an area that looked nice for a bear to take a nap, and we had heard bears were nearby. I asked if we could continue walking. Maybe another 75-100 feet walking through the meadow parallel with the road she had asked if she could practice her bigfoot calls, sure I thought, midday, perfect to practice. She had let off 3 quick calls and we waited for maybe a minute before we kept walking. Then she came upon the ants. These ants were having a war, but I was too busy thinking of that bear I might run into and wanted to keep walking. But instead took the opportunity to just look. Just look at my surroundings. I was staring off into the treeline for a minute or two, when through the trees I saw something big and fast move from my left to right without making any noise. In that short amount of time, I am fairly certain that I had seen a hand. But it was mostly the texture of the hair that struck me. Very straggly, knotted, long but not being picked up away from the body as it ran. I tried to keep my eyes on it but it disappeared as quick as I saw it, before I saw another flash of it through the trees only this time looking bigger in width. After that I didn't see it again. I radioed to our main camp to let them know what I had seen. And we sat down. Just looking into the woods, trying to listen for anything. When a deer walked down the meadow from the direction we had come from, stopped maybe 20-30feet from us before it took off screaming. Some more of our fellow campers arrived and we went a little further into the woods. I did not see anything else the rest of that day.

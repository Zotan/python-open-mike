One night about a year ago during fire season me my husband and three children took a drive at night to see what damaged accrued on the reservation. It was a clear night and so my 14 year old daughter and I got out to walk and to look for hot spots. Well we heard some loud grunts and we turned to look but it was hard to see so I had my husband turn the headlights on and we all saw three, very ugly hairy hairy people. One was about 7 to 8 foot, the other was about 7 ft but it wasn't as hairy and the little little one was about the size of a kid, age range from 7 to 9 years. Well the big one took its arm and raised it and did a half circle motion. It made the most fierce noise and we took off.

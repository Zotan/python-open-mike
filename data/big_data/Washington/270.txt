Well it was about 8:30 in the morning I got up in to relive myself from the night, as i got out the tent I heard BIG steps, only four but it sounded like somebody was really pounding there feat in the ground going up the hill. I had my gun with me and told my girlfriend there is something big over there knowing I had A bear tag I looked over and over. About an fifteen minutes later I resumed making coffee and my breakfast about 9:30 to 10:00a.m. I started hearing this pounding like something taking a rock and hiting a tree over and over then pauses then hitting again I asked my girl friend who was still in the tent in a whisper "Hay, hay did you hear that" she said "what" I said"listen" and she heard it too then it stopped I heard steps in the woods then the steps stopped I just had an fealing I was being watched I then packed up and went home.

While driving Blacksnake Ridge doing field work I came across large bipedal footprint going across Blacksnake ridge.  i got out to investigate the tracks. From heel to heel to prints were 4 1/2 feet apart, tracks were approx 16 inches long. one tracks still had toe impressions in it.  I counted about 20 good tracks and there were others that were fading out. I shot video of the tracks and went home.  The next day I went back up to look for more in that location and found more across the road but they were badly weatherd.

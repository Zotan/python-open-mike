At 3:45 in the morning on Shi Shi Beach N., myself and two other backpackers woke up to the sounds of my dog running after something. The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches. There were sounds of grappling/contact between my dog and the animal. I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark. The first words to come out of my mouth were "identify yourself!" The figure made no growling sound, no sound as it moved, and had no backpack or headlamp. I think it kicked the dog to get away from it. After my friend comes up behind me and grabs the dog somehow, I manage to find the headlamp after 5 minutes. Before we can turn it on and look at the ridge, my friend looks over my shoulder and sees a human figure/torso approach the top of the ridge, set its hand down on a large rock next to it, and then disappear. He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body. During the initial struggle, my friend also notes a sound he heard. It was an elk-like horn sound that was similar to moaning. I didn't feel like the sound was directed at me but we were in a cove and the figure was fleeing - sounds bounce around. My friend also suggested the idea that the figure ran UP the ridge at a 35 degree angle which is not possible for a human. I convinced myself that it was a human assailant coming to steal our backpacking gear... Yet the figure did not identify itself, was not wearing a headlamp, and somehow scaled the cliff in pitch black. By far the creepiest backpacking experience I have ever had.

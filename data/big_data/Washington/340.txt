I will break these down into the three events, divided by the types of events.  The first two are from hearing screams at night.  The third is a brief sighting. One night, when I was around nine years old, I was asleep under an open window at my Grandparent's house.  Sometime during the night, I was awakened by a loud roaring scream from the woods across the yard and roadway.  It was brief.  It lasted just enough to wake me up and hear it continue for a few seconds.  I didn't want to look out the window, but would likely have seen nothing, for at the time, there was very dense forest across the street. The scream seemed to come from within the woods.  It took me a long time to get back to sleep. Sometime later, I heard a scream in a documentary about bigfoot that was almost identical to what I heard that night.  No one else in the house heard the screams, or just never said anything about it if they did.

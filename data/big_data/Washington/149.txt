We were there @8 days. First two days & nights were fine. After that we started hearing what sounded like a lady moaning or "howling" across the field. Also tree knocks in the far tree line across the field. It seemed like it would happen in one spot & then another would respond in another area. The next couple nights it seemed to get closer until it sounded like it was in the woods right behind our tent. (Very loud knocks, usually 2 at a time.) Also got growled at 4 times from right outside the tent one night maybe @ the sixth night. We stormed out of tent with guns & flashlights & didn't see anything & didn't hear anything running away! Also during the day after hunting we came back to find a smaller tree with full fresh rootball placed across the entrance to our camp site. (It wasn't dragged there, there was no dirt drag marks anywhere & we looked around & couldn't find where it was pulled from. There were also some other big limbs placed there too. (I have pics of the tree.). Keep in mind there was no other campers or hunters in the whole valley the whole week.) The last night we came back to camp and a large healthy green pine tree was pushed over in the woods & landed right in the middle of our camp. This was the last straw for us, we couldn't take the stress anymore & needed sleep. We left camp and drove to my families cabin at Priest Lake & slept there. My buddy left the lantern on in the tent before we left and when we came back the next morning the tent zipped was unzipped about 6-7 inches & we had zipped it up tight. I also have pics of this & the bigger tree that was pushed over.

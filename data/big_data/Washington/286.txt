It was late at night but the moon was very bright.  My mother had come to pick me up from the Monroe McDonald's as I could not drive yet.  We were way up 171st when on the side of the road standing next to a street sign was a large shape.  As the head lights hit it, it was apparent there was a large creature that was not a bear standing next to the road.  The side shine of the lights kept it lit until we passed.  Even though I know it could not see inside the car, It felt like my eyes were locked on its as we drove by.  I spun in the seat and was looking behind us.  It walked up on the road paused to look and the light of the moon illuminated it fairly well.  It walked down the other side.  My mother asked if I saw that.  I said yes... she asked if i wanted her to turn around... at the time I said no. It was huge.  At least 8 feet tall as it towered next to the sign.  The color was dark brownish   and the shoulders where massive.  The eyes were green. When I started watching your show, I drove to where it happened and there was power lines right there.  I smiled with the knowledge of what you guys have taught me because it made perfect sense. I have looked at the map and there are lots of small ponds in that area. 3 years ago I met someone and we exchanged stories.  He showed me on the map where they roam and has claimed he sees them all the time.  I would love to share this information with you and show you on a map where he told me.

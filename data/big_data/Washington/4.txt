We showed up and set up camp around 5:00pm. Started the fire and around 9:00pm the noises followed shortly therafter. We heard the noise about a half mile away and it progressevly got louder. It was still getting darker when we heard the noises and we saw a bird flying overhead and swooping down and then the noise was heard. We are all pretty sure that the noise was not bear or elk. It sounded like a schreech howl grunt. We heard the noise again the next day around the same time.

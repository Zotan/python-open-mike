At 3:30 am on July 1 2017. I was delivering newspapers and heard a loud howl then about a minute later a deeper sounding howl with a grunt like sound at the end. It gave me a really nervous feeling. Made me jumpy feeling. I have never heard anything like it before. 2 hours later on my return trip to finish paper route. I looked around the area I had heard the sounds and saw the brush broken down on the upward bank of the hillside, like something big had climbed up the bank. Very dark at 3:30 that morning, then normal daylight.

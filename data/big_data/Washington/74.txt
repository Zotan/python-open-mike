September 12, 2006 Elk hunting on Salt Creek trail around Mt. Adams. 3 miles up where Cascade and Salt Creek meet there is a boulder Garden where the 2 rivers meet.  About 200 yards up on Salt Creek side 40 ft from the river on the North end their is a print that is unidentifiable to any animal print I've ever seen.  I am an avid hunter and spend all year foraging, fishing, and hunting in the NW so I'm very familar with animal prints but this one had me puzzled.  It had the characteristics of a human foot but was twice the width and the toes seemed like they where possibly 3 times the width.  I know everybodies thinking BEAR right know but this was not a bear print.  I've hunted and tracked bears for many years and this was not it.  It was a foot of what looked like a Gorilla or something. If any body has time they should journey on up there pick some Chantrelles and Matzutakes on the way up.

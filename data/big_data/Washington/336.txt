While bear hunting I found many broken saplings, all pointing in the same direction, and all at the same height. I thought it strange due to the fact that smaller trees all around them were not broken. The next day it was pouring rain and I came across a bare footprint in the road. I wear size 13 boots, and I could have fit my entire boot inside of it. The track had to have been made within 20 minutes of me being there, as the rain was pouring so hard it would have washed the track away if it was any longer than that.

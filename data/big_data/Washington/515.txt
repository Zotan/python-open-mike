K and C worked at a store in Factoria store and told J and his friend E about the great fishing spot on Rattlesnake Lake. (see report #1478). K didn't tell them until after their strange event that two years before they thought they were chased onto Crib dam by something on the lake bank. Turned out that it just ran off into the woods, but it was hairy and ran upright on two legs. K now is a fishing guide in Port Angeles.

It was early to mid-August when myself and 4 friends decided to camp in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Around dusk, we heard something in the trees near our campsite.  Whatever it was walked through the brush quite loudly.  We figured it was a bear and made noise and scared it away.  Later that night, however, we began to hear some sort of scream.  None of us knew what it was, but we all agreed it was like nothing we've ever heard.  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away.  Until recently, we still wondered what we heard, but then we listened to vocalizations on this website and heard the same sounds.  What we heard was very similar to the 1978 Snohomish County recording.  We now believe that we heard at least 1 sasquatch howling that night we were camping.

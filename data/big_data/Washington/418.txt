archery elk season,opening day. I was archery hunting, I found some very big tracks. I back tracked them to the canyon I had just hunted. These tracks went about 5 or 6 hundred yards along a clearcut. I lost them in the timber. these tracks sunk deep in to the dirt. they had 5 toes and a heel about 12in behind the toes.

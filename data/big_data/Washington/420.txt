I had just recently purchased a cabin in the Blue Mountains  of Washington, and my friend and I were in the process of doing some repairs. We later decided to drive down into the Tucannon area to do some fishing in Spring lake. I had been fishing for around a half hour when Steve got bored and started around the lake, he was on his way back when from behind us across the road where we had to park came a very loud gutteral howling accompanied by grunting and sounds of anger, some bushs were being totally thrashed, this caught us extremly off guard and we just looked in the direction for some time waiting to see what had made the sounds. Getting dark we decided we did not want to meet what ever it was in the dark and crossed the road and got into the truck, we had to drive right by where we had heard the sounds, we never saw any bushs being trashed, only heard them. We drove around up and down the adjoining forest roads for sometime to look for tracks and for a possible sighting, but we heard or saw nothing more.

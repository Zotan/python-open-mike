My grandfather whom was familiar with this region and hunted this mountain country yearly by horseback,saw what i believe to be a Pacific Northwest Sasquatch. Although he never would say for sure what he really thought of the incident {he was very humble} except that he had seen something eye to eye that he felt confident few men had ever seen.......and he conveyed a deep feeling of respect for the creature. My grandfather rarely spoke of the incident, but he felt safe telling my father the details. Those who don't believe in the creature probably never had a reason to feel otherwise, but my grandfather was an honest, humble outdoorsman who new the backcountry of Washington, Idaho & Oregon very well......he saw a Sasquatch that fall day in 1967.

Hubert & Doris Smith were my uncle & aunt. He is deseased & she lives in Texas. They sold out in 1968. They had never heard of big foot prior to this incidence and thought they were having contact with a giant of some sort. An awful smell in the dairy barn then footprints in the barn lot leading up the hill to dense forest. A few days later tracks were found next to creek. Plaster of Paris prints were made. [Hubert & Doris Smith residence] Shortly after this, the school bus driver reported seeing a bigfoot cross the road in front of the bus. This was down by Jim Creek on 242nd st. Note: This happened before the road was designated 242nd., but it was where the big main power-line crosses the road.

I was working as a snowplow driver for the State of Washington and at the time I was traveling eastbound on Highway 2 towards Leavenworth.  I was approaching a train trestle, and my lights caught a large animal, on the bridge, walking towards a train tunnel.  I couldn't stop but it was clear that there was something there that wasn't there the previous 8 times I passed thru that area.

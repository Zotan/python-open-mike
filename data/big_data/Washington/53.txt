In the spring of 1981 me and my family were camping up the Lewis river.We were out on a bush wack hike{not on a trail} we came across a large foot print on the edge of a creek.We keep it to our selves for all these years until I heard about your web site.I also was hunting out side Packwood Wa in oct 1999 and heard an incredible sound I have never heard before,It was so loud and the woods went silent when it was done.

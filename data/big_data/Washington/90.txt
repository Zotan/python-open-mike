Grande Coulee, Wash -- Mid Aug 2002 Spring Canyon -- Way up in the canyon, there is a densely wooded region behind a dry water fall, in the highest part of the canyon to the SouthEast.  I didn't actually see anything, but having climbed up there to get a view, I was warned in no uncertain terms -- a grunting hum with a stamping of feet.  The Beast inhaled and exhaled with a sound like a large bull.  The animal must have enomous girth, given the sound.  And then total silence.  I altered by approach to the water fall's edge.  I waited, no sounds, no nothing.  I wasn't going in those woods, however. I thought it might be a rogue bull, but given what I've heard about how BigFoot is, how he sounds, the rocky hard-to-get-to area, and the very dense vegatation.  It might be a BigFoot residence.  It's probably worth a look.

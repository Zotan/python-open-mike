Upright figure covered in black hair walking across road 20 to 50 ft. in front of our car as we drove home. I did not see much, as I wasn't looking forward until my mother screamed. My mother claims the creature was like a hideous ape with arms dragging. Size: "taller than your father"; Note: My father is 6'9".

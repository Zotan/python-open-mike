June 22, 2014 While on a dirt bike riding trip with three friends we came to an intersection of two dirt roads about 7 miles north of Plain, WA.  As soon as we stopped and turned off the motorcycles we heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick.  We initially didn't think much of it as we were not familiar with the immediate area and assumed that there were people near by.  Two of us walked closer to the intersection to see if there were other motorcycles or vehicles parked down the road. We found none.  After several minutes, hearing no other sounds, I picked up a stick and hit a tree two times.  Within three seconds we heard two or three very loud tree knocks.  At this time we got on our motorcycles and left the area immediately.  The next day two of us returned to the same location to see if we could find a trail or a campsite in the area where we heard the knocking. The forest was thick and there were no signs of any trails or camping sites .  I have the exact location marked on my cell phone gps.

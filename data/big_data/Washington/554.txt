I just got done taking photos of foot prints by my brother's house in Cle Elum. The prints measure 15" long, the strides are over 4 1/2', and they are all single file. The prints come up from the creek through the field, through their blue gate, around the edge of the yard and disappear down the driveway. There are abundant elk, deer, wild turkey and snowshoe hare in the area along with grouse.

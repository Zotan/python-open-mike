From about fifty yards away I spotted a hairy man-like creature standing in a field next to the road. It was very large and standing upright, it was about 6 ft. to 7 ft. tall, it had broad shoulders and a thick neck, but the head seemed small compared to its body size. It did not display any aggressive behavior, it really just seemed to be curious. It also did not appear to be frightened.

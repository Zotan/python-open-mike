Last fall I lived in Eatonville, WA on Mashell Ave S just north of Alder St for about 7 months in an apartment at the edge of town. It was about 8:15pm in late November 2014 so it was dark, chilly, and clear outside. I had just gotten home and walked up to my front door and was about to push my key into the lock when I heard, what I can only describe as, a “hooting” noise like “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot” in rapid succession. I paused and turned around slowly and walked to the edge of my doorstep listening closer and it happened a second time “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot.” Following the second vocalization, all of the dogs in town began barking and howling incessantly. The noises did not sound very close, but it was extremely loud and sounded like it carried over from the mountain just south of town. I waited a little longer, but heard nothing more and so retreated to my apartment.  It sounded extremely ape-like and I have never heard anything like that before or since. The closest resemblance to those noises that I can find are in vocalization clips found on The Gorilla Foundation website www.Koko.org/vocalizations, only the vocalizations I heard had more “scream” to them and were much louder and very powerful. The sound went right through you and came from something with a huge chest. This was no coyote, elk, owl or otherwise, none of those can make a vocal this powerful. No one else was around at the time.

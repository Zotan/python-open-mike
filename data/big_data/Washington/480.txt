The first time we heard this sound we where having a fire close to the wooded swamp area behind my house.  It was about 2am and we did not see any thing but heard it many times that night.  We heard a long whooping type growl....that was late summer 2008... Winter is almost over and we are out late at night and are starting to hear it again...march 2009...3am

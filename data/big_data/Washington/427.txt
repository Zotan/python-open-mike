You guys need to go to Washington state and go too the Gifforard Pinchot forest where there is a river called Yellow Jacket and the Cispus river flow together. I have seen and heard weird things there and me and my nephew seen a big foot walking towards us and my friend seen them recently and got pictures on his phone of two or maybe three of them the people who live their have seen them or heard them I believe that if you go there for not just one day and night it will take you about four to five days before you might see one if you try looking for them you wont see them but if you just camp out and hang out for awhile I am pretty sure that something will get your attention there is all kinds of signs there.

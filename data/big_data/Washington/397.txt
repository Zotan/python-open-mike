Earl Willits (from the Seattle Athletic Club), ? Floyd (a ranger at the time), Bob Ferris (radio personality) and Melrose Stevens were walking their horses quitely along a trail. They were not talking, just taking in the scenery when a black, 8' tall creature got up from a stoop on the left side of the trail and ran away, leaving a foul odor. Never thought to look for footprints.

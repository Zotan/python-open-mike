This has never been reported... Two teenagers were riding dirt bikes on an old over grown logging road and stopped for a cigarette at a small lake or beaver pond. They were there for just a couple of minutes (3-4) when a loud blood-curtling scream was heard coming from an opposite ridge about a mile away, no more than two. The scream lasted at most 15 seconds and varied in pitch and tone through out it's length. It made the hairs on the back of their necks stand up. There were no roads on the opposite ridge. They immediately got back on their bikes and left, only telling immediate family members about the scream they heard. No other people or ground marks indicating recent human activity were seen.

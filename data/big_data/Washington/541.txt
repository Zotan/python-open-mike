Joe Hester called me about some footprints that they found after setting up an elk hunting camp. They were in deep snow and we tracked them down below snow level. They were 19 1/2 inches long and 9 inches wide. My husbands boots were size 15, he is 6'8" tall and weighs more than 200 lbs with a 38" inseam. The strides were enormous. Tracks led away from camp.

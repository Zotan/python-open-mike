We moved to Clear Lake Washington in March 2018. About a week ago, now April 6 2018, I heard loud vocalizations, 1 then a silence and 2 min later 5 to 7 in a row. The next night my husband heard loud what he said sounded like tree knocks. That same night, I was in our travel trailer alone in bed when I heard a voice outside the window. Nobody was around and then the trailer started moving. No wind or anything organic to make it move.  We live across the road from a clear cut logging area and there is woods all around, we live on a lake and have a creek running through the property.

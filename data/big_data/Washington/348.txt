This is how it all started i was walking home from my boyfriends house i would have to walk [past a] creak it was about 10:00 p.m. something kept throwning stuff at me like sticks and rocks i would turn around and look but i could not see anything then i would have to go across a Bridge it would not stop follow[ing] me it would hide when cars go by it had this really bad smell to it i did[n't] like the smell so i started running i knew it was a something so i just ran [and] stood on the bridge [and] it ran when i ran then it ran into the bushes and started throwing sticks and rocks on the bridge where i was i could[n't] see it really good but it was the scarys thing in my life

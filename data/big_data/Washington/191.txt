April? 2003 Washington state. A friend and I drove from Seattle towards Mount Rainier. Heading south on the 164/410 we pulled off onto one of many dirt roads just a few miles south of Enumclaw. I drove a few miles and parked. We hiked in the forest for a few hours and when we tried to get back to the freeway someone had locked some yellow gates on all the access roads. We had to spend the night in the car and right after dark we began hearing what sounded like hard wood beating on soft wood(like someone hitting a tree with a baseball bat) very close, maybe within 100 ft. We were terrified and drove around the access roads for a few miles and within minutes of shutting the car off it started again very close. This was not just a loud noise echoing all throughout the woods, even from inside the car I could definately tell this was within throwing distance and directed at us. We left and drove several miles again and again minutes after the car stopped the noise started again. We drove until we found a road that was seperated by just a ten foot ravine from the freeway and still it started, this time more distant in the forest. It lasted for the next couple of hours until the sun rose. I swear to god this is the truth, I have no reason to lie.

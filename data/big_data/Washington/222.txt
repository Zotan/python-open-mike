I was awake and laying in bed with the window open at around sunrise. I heard two wood knocks that sounded very close in the nearby forest followed immediately by a more distant howl. It was a very deep howl. It sounded like a large animal. I have heard elk bugles and this was not what I heard. I have also heard coyotes from here so I am familiar to what they sound like. The sound seemed too deep and guttural to be from a man or any other familiar animal.

I was 9 years old. It was May 18th 1980 between 8am and 9am (Yes, the day Mt. Saint Helens blew its top.). My family was going to get some white landscape rocks from a rock pit west of Trout Lake, WA. We were on Highway 141 in the Ice Caves area. I saw bigfoot run across the highway. It took him 2 steps to get across the highway.

I was working in my recently logged acreage when I found 10 field mice wrapped in grass packages.  there were more mice parts nearby seemingly awaiting packaging. I gathered the wrapped rodents to bring them back to the house when a rock, apparently thrown, hit my gloved hand nearly breaking my hand.  I have heard screams on occassion from the woods but haven't seen any animal. This happened in the morning of june 2nd.

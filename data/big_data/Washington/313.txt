I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.  So I hiked for a while enjoying the sights and the trail forks in a y-shape and I took a left and walked up the hill.  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree.  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked.  It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.  I was yellin and shoutin at it but it just stood their and kept looking away from me, and I knew that this thing is not going to move unless I go over there and at that point I left the forest by going back where I came from.

I'm sorry to say I don't have a very exciting report.  Last summer when I was out at our cabin with our boys, I heard this really weird "yelling" from the ridge in back of our house.  Our cabin boarders the National Forest, so it gets pretty dense back there.  It was very late at night, and I was alone with the kids that night so I didn't tell them (I didn't want to spook them).  At first I thought it was some teenagers partying up on the forest service road, but that would be impossible to hear, really, and it wasn't like that at all. The "yells" went on for a long time. They sounded, perhaps, 1/2 mile away? I was actually pretty scared.  There are quite a few houses up at our place, but almost noone is there but me and boys on week days. Also, a few weeks before my neighbor who is a hunter and such heard "screaming" from closer in to his place.  Just thought I'd let you know.

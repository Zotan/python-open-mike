I was with my sister and her friend, it was night time around 9:30 p.m. When we arrived at the friends house in Granite Falls we all went inside and at that time I remember I left my smokes on the dashboard of the car so I went out to get them. As I approached the car I got an eerie feeling that something was watching me so I turned around to look and there across the road from me, was a tall hairy creature looking at me. I was so scared I could not move at first. But then I ran back into the house and told them what I saw. No one would go out to look they were too scared. I know what I saw and it wasn't a bear or a person playing a joke. It was around 8 to 9 feet tall and very large. I couldn't see its face it was too dark and there was only light from a house down the road where it became forest.

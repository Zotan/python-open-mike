I was driving down South Kingston road January 25th on a Tuesday at about 1030pm. After coming around the last turn before the road turns to Miller Bay Road I saw something I will never forget. It looked as though a tall dark man was standing behind a tree. My headlights shined right at it and it seemed to try to pull its body behind the tree. It sent shivers up my back! I have had dreams about it ever since that night and I still have no idea what I saw.

While driving home from a July 4th fireworks display near Mt. Rainier, I witnessed a 10 foot bigfoot cross the highway and enter a stand of douglas fir. I was driving west towards Elbe and eventually home to Eatonville, WA.  I saw "someone" crossing the highway about 70 to 100 yards off in the distance, but they were silouhetted by a light source from behind and so could not determine the sex of the "person". We were driving about 60 mph and quickly closed the distance between the car and the figure crossing the road.  At first, I assumed it was a drunk woman who we had picked up wandering out in the dark forested highway the week  before (she was drunk and her boyfriend had kicked her out of his truck to walk home in the dark). As we got closer, the figure stepped off the pavement and onto the grass on the side of the road, lifting one arm to push a douglas fir bough from in front of its face as it entered the trees... at that moment, I recall asking, "Why are they wearing a fur coat in July?" and noticing an ear on the side of the head, in the location and appearance the same as that of a gorilla. The hair on my arms and the back of my neck stood straight up and I locked up the brakes and turned the steering wheel and headlights towards the trees... the car stalled and my wife became hysterical and so I left and returned the next day to look for tracks.

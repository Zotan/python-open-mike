This sighting took place back when i lived in washington last year. I was sitting on my windowsill at 11 at night, i lived next to a large wetland/swamp area. my back yard was a large hill infront of the wetland. I was sitting on my windowsill and saw a large figure come out of wetland, walk down the hill, and then re-enter the wetland at the bottom of the hill. The figure was probally 7 feet tall (i doubt it was 8 or 9) dark in color, and very large in build.

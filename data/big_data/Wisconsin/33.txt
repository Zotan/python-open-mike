I had gone up to visit a friend of mine and I was driving home. It was just getting dark. I was South, outside of Peshtigo WI. I had gone to Marinette WI for the weekend. I looked down to turned on my radio when I looked up  a huge black and brown creature ran across in front of my car about 60 ft in front of me. I slowed down to about 35mph  not sure what I had seen. I looked in the direction it ran and didn't see anything through the trees. I had my window cracked and smelled a skunk type smell. At that point I locked my car door rolled my window up and got out of there.

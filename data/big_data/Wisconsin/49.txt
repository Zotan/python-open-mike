I was traveling down Highway NN when I glanced over and saw something upright.  It was NOT a bear. I know what a black bear looks like and this was huge and on two feet. I slammed on the brakes and backed up to the location (to view down the road where I saw it). I stayed there for a few minutes to see if I could hear or see anything. It was so dead quiet not even birds were heard. I was rather freaked out about the situation and was a little scared.

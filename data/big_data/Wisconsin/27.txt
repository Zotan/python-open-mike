Hello This is something that had happened twice in 2 years .But in the same month of August. I believe in August of 2010 at night I had smelled something very very bad like body odor at night. It was an august summer night my dogs (2 labs) just looked at the window and didn't even bark or move. But I remember earlier that night the dogs wouldn't even go outside.So it was about 2 in the morning and I got up and closed my windows because of the smell. That was the only time I had smelled anything like that ever. Then last summer 2011 in august again I was out hanging clothes to dry (I work 2nd shift) on the line. I could hear the coyotes barking from the other side of the lake which I live on and the coyotes barking out behind a horse pasture behind my place . My dogs were over by the lake.Then all of a sudden they came running to the driveway facing the pasture . They wouldn't go past the light of the house.And the weird thing was all the noises I was hearing like the coyotes and the night noises stopped. The dogs kept looking up the driveway and at the little bit of swamp next to the house.So after I got my clothes hung up I got into the house as fast as I could. One thing that made me think about what had happened was from watching your show. And even know I haven't seen one I do believe . I have also seen a wolf up here that was as large as the front of my car 4 feet tall at the back .It was the biggest wolf I have ever seen.

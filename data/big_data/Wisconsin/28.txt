A couple years ago I sent you a report that my daughter and I heard a very loud series of calls that I thought could have been made by a bigfoot. After listening to the recordings of calls from central MI I am more convinced. In my report I had trouble putting into words what it sounded like, but the recordings are nearly exact as some of the recordings. Then this fall I was in the hospital and my wife started smoking and sitting on the porch at night for her nightly puff. She told me the coyotes were howling a lot. When I played the recording of what I heard she came from the next room and said (that's what I heard). My sister works with my neighbor's wife, she said they have her husband and I are long time hunters, I have hunted in Canada, Alaska, Idaho, and WI where I live. Now a wolf in our area would be almost unheard of. I don't think they live here but they may migrate through.

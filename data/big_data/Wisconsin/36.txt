I was cutting grass at my cabin near a small stream when I kept smelling a rotten odor.  I stopped cutting and looked for the source but never found it. Later in the day I made a campfire and was sitting outside by the fire when a deer walked in the yard and was promptly chased by my dogs. A short time later a whippoorwill started calling and my one dog kept barking at it. At approximately 10 pm suddenly both dogs ran to the edge of the yard, hair up, growling and barking. They were under a yard light. Just out of the light something called twice, a loud "scree, scree." I have never heard this sound before. This continued for about two to three minutes, every 30 seconds. While this was going on I put the dogs in the cabin where they kept barking and the calls continued for two more minutes. Then the calls stopped and the dogs kept still. Then I kept smelling this rotten odor off and on and heard something walking out of sight in the trees. Then the sounds and smell were gone. I know it was not a bird or deer and as I have heard one scream one night and have seen one in the daylight. I feel this was a curious Bigfoot by the cabin.  I took pictures of tracks in the yard in 2016 on december 27th in the snow where one walked thru the yard. I'm thinking there possibly is a group in this area.

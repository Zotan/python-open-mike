Dear Bigfoot Crew, I do not watch your show but I did not know who to contact after a squatch sighting.  My parents believe I am crazy, but I did see him!! I live on the corner of Henry and Langdon in Madison, WI.  I saw him at Lake mendota walking on the shore at the end of N. Henry st. When I saw him he must've been 7-8 feet tall with a ton of hair.  I found it extremely odd to see him by uw-madison campus.  It was definitely him!! Other people with me and that live here see him. Thanks,

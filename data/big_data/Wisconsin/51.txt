I was driving home from work on a rural road at night and it was raining.  I saw what I thought at first to be a man walking along the edge of the road in a brown jacket and pants until I got closer and saw that this was much too big to be a man. After I went by I realized that this was possibly a big foot creature.  I kept this to my self for fear I would be made fun of.  But my dad also says he has seen them when he was out fishing some years ago. My sister also told me that she saw one in the same area.  This was in Iowa county, Wisconsin.

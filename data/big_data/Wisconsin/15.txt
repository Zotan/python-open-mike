It was 2:30 in the afternoon when I saw a dark figure walking along a ridge. It had a long stride with arms swinging high during its walk. I thought it was a shadow of a man walking but the sun was not out. I previously saw two hunters who were wearing 100% blaze orange - this thing was all dark. I thought it was a landowner coming down to talk to me but after disappearing behind some bushes I never saw it again. The distance between us was approximately 100 yards. I became a little uneasy when I heard loud sounds like branches braking in the forest and decided to leave the area.

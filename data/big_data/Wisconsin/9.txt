My father and I went to Loew Lake because I had heard there had been sasquatch activity in the area. We hiked the trails for about two hours without much luck finding anything. I did find tree structures near the area where hunting is prohibited, and I took a picture of each of the two potential tree structures we had found. So as we were heading back to our car after hiking for two hours, I decided to pick up a stick and try making some wood knocks. To our surprise, there was a response. Mind you, we had been hearing gunshots in the area, local wildlife, and the sounds of trees scraping against each other. And what we heard was a knocking noise we couldn't explain. I knocked once, and we heard a knock in reply. Then I knocked in a series of three, and we got a three knocked response. Then, the knocks started going rapid one after another. I then replied in the same fashion, knocking rapidly one after another. Then it stopped. I made several attempts later to try tree knocking again in hopes of getting a response again, but no luck. I had the idea that if it was a sasquatch, it figured out it wasn't communicating with another Sasquatch so it stopped replying. My dad and I both heard it and decided that it could have only been either another human being messing with us or it was in fact a sasquatch. This makes me want to look into the area more. Because we never heard that noise until I started tree knocking the first time. And then never heard the noise again. We ruled out the idea that is was just a wood pecker, because wood peckers make noise whenever they want and not really in reply to something. To my knowledge, nothing in our area in terms of animals could make a knocking noise such as that.

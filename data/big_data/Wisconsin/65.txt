I was fishing in northwest Barron county late September of 2011. I made a cast and followed my lure in flight when it hit the water I noticed movement beyond my lure.on  the side of the hill. I couldn't believe my eyes it was grey about seven or eight feet tall it was hard to judge the height because of the steepness of the hill. it was hanging on to one tree and grabbing another when it was coming down the hill. it froze in its tracks when it noticed me looking at him. He slowly pulled him self back up the hill, then he stood there for 2 seconds and looked at me; then he continued up the hill, never making a sound. I was about 20 yards away. I went home and rationalized it for a couple of days,before I told my friend about what I had seen,before I could describe it to him he told me what color it was. He said it was seen the same time the year before on the ice age trail, about a quarter mile from his house.

I came across some tracks in fresh snow one time and possibly heard wood knocking.  NOW I WATCH YOUR SHOW AND IT ALL COMES TOGETHER. What I seen and heard that day made me believe. I seen the tracks some people believe to be that of a sasquatch but I can tell you half of them are not. The tracks I followed in fresh snow that day were so detailed. I never seen anything anywhere posted that comes even close.

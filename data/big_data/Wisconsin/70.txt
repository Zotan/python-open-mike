Hi Guys, I am going on over thirty sightings/encounters in northern Wisconsin. I've had as many as 4 up to my cabin at a time. Last October I was hunting when I saw a big silver big foot. he was at least 9-10 feet high. I was less than 20 yards from him. Was funny, I think he almost smiled cuz he was soo busted. I just laughed. I walked to the trail he was on and couldn't believe how fast he disappeared. Two weeks later I was in my cabin and turned towards my sink when I saw one leaning down to peek in at me. Made my neck hair stand up. went to the window and all I saw was a gigantic shadow from the yard lite. WAS AWESOME. If you folks ever want to come up... yell.

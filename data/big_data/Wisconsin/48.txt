On June 30th, 2018, at approximately 9:45pm, I was headed south on Highway 13, approximately two miles south of Park Falls in Price County, Wisconsin. It was dark, with my headlights the only light source. In summary, while driving at approximately 50mph, an animal on all fours ran in front of my vehicle (2015 Ford Taurus SHO) - left to right/east to west.  I nearly hit the animal as it came within five feet of the front of my vehicle. My observation was only a split second, but it left a very big impression, mainly because it didn’t make sense (as explained in the last paragraph). My wife was in the passenger seat, but was on her phone texting, and she only looked up because I swerved to avoid the animal. She never observed it. Hairy and brown, I did not see the head, mainly because it was slumped down on fours, and the fast speed it was moving. My dimensions are approximate from my viewpoint as the driver 46” high (legs), 46” (long) torso = 92” or 7’6” if standing. (I took a tape measure, and immediately took approximate measurements after arriving to my destination five or six miles away). I’ve been vacationing in this area since 1975 as a child. It was not a black beer (brown beer are not indigenous to this area), it wasn’t a deer, wolf or coyote. With this in mind, I’m left with a lot of unanswered questions, and quite possibly someone else saw this animal too.

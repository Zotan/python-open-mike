I am a career Army Infantry soldier and also a criminal investigator. I found and photographed three-footprints following a stream. I put dollar bills down to document the size, I also believe that the stride was at least 5 feet between two of the prints. I believe the prints were of a two-legged creature with a foot size of at least 15 inches.

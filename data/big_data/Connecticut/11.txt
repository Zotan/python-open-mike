I don't have a specific incident to report but I live in a rural area of Torrington CT. While my wife and I have never seen anything we hear strange noises constantly starting at dusk and continuing through the night. At least once every couple of months we hear knocking and dragging noises against our house and on windows that are approximately 6 and half feet off the ground. Occasionally load thumps against the house are also heard. Once in a while on our porch smoking a cigarette, me and a friend experienced something very large running through the field behind my house. We could not see anything but from my experience in the area it was very heavy and moving in a straight line across the field. Also the cows in the back lot have gone crazy more then once very late in the night. I cant say its Bigfoot but we have something going on here. Thanks for your time. Please excuse my grammar I'm using my phone for this.

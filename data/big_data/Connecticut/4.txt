On Saturday afternoon on August 4, 2018 at approximately 2pm my boyfriend and I were driving from Berlin to Woodbridge about halfway there I was staring out the passenger side window as my boyfriend was driving. In a clearing of the woods I saw what looked to be an extremely tall man with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creature’s arms, chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair. He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward, swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs. As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could. My boyfriend asked me why I did that and I told him, “I think just saw a Sasquatch. I just saw the weirdest thing and it was not a human.” And went on to describe what I saw.

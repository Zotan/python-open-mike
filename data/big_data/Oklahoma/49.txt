As reported to Roger Roberts. The witness, age 18, observed one bigfoot "slowly jogging" across Holson Valley Road; which is two lane blacktop, west of Cedar Lake. He described the creature as "military brown" in color, with long matted hair, heavy set, over 6 ft tall, "fat head" and whiskers. The witness's total time of observation was approximately 10 seconds. The area is devoid of houses and is somewhat remote. The creature never looked in his direction, and continued to "jog" up hill on two legs after crossing the road.

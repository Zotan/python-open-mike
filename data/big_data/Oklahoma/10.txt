Alright me and some friends were camping out about 10 miles south of Barnsdall, Oklahoma and we had to run some girls to wooloroc to meet their ride. After we dropped them off we headed back south to Barnsdall, we were driving and something caught my eye on the side of the road.  I looked over and my friend was seeing the same thing. It was bent over in a ditch by a guardrail and was about 5 feet tall squatted down.  It was probably about 3 to 4 foot wide. As we passed it just kinda glanced over at us. This was happening around 1:00 a.m. that night. We were just blank minded and then finally decided to turn around and go back to see if we could still see it. But when we got back there we couldn't find the creature. We back the next day and could only find flattened grass.

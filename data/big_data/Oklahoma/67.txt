My friend and I were leaving her house.  We decided to check out a tree in her yard that we thought we had seen something in about 2 weeks before.  The tree was about 60 yards from her house and close to the road.  We drove down to the tree and I had my bright lights on and was about 50 ft away from the tree.  We saw something huge and white sitting on a branch of the tree.  I saw the head and shoulders.  The shoulders were broad and it didn't look like it had a neck.  My friend saw two legs dangling down.  The legs were hairy and were moving.  The head and shoulders were moving slightly back and forth like it was getting ready to jump down.  My friend screamed and shouted "go, go, go".  I was in shock, but managed to put the car in reverse and backed out as fast as I could and drove off.  I called my brother on my cell phone and my friend called her mother and told her not to come out of the house.

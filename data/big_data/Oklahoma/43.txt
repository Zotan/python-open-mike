I found what was left of a black and tan coonhound after it had been shot in the head and dumped at the Honobia, OK town dump. All the soft tissue (organs/muscles/connective tissue,etc.)was gone (with the exception of the entire head, the four paws and the skin and hair). It was apparently eaten by the same animal that had pulled upwards on the hound's chest wall and stretched out ligaments in an upward motion. The ligaments did not break but were stretched enough to easily remove the contents of the chest cavity. The ribs and the sternum, as I recall, were still held together by this stretched out ligament.The head was totally untouched except for the .22 cal. bullet hole in it's temple.  The hound's skin had been pulled apart over the abdomen and chest and peeled back and was laying in the same spot where it fell after being separated (on each side of the body, but still attached to the back of the dog. There were no teeth marks on the bones. The hound's eyes were still present and untouched.  Only inches away there was a dark and greasy spot that smelled, not surprisingly, like a dead dog...horrible. The dark greasy spot was about three feet in circumference and was on very hard flat ground. There was nothing noticible on the dark spot, just a dark tint to the ground. I believe that it took the use of human-like hands to pull the chest upwards in the manner that it was pulled and stretched out. I suspect a sasquatch.

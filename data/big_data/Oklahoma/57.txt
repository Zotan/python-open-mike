I was driving down highway 59 from Heavener to Poteau. I turned right on co road 133 and about 100 ft onto the street on the right side of the road was a huge figure standing bout 7ft+ on the side of the road kind of hunched over and I guess when it saw my lights it spooked em cause it ran off into the trees I slowed down to see what it was don't know where it went after that cause it spooked me.

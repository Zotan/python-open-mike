A hairy bi-pedal creature carrying a calf or deer carcass over its left shoulder crossed the road from East to West, approximately 150 yards in front of my pick-up truck during a brief rain storm. A part-time rig hand with me in the truck also witnessed the creature. The following day we found several partial footprints along the creek bank on the West side of the road. We lost the tracks after 10-15 yards in the dense undergrowth.

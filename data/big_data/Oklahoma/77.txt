I saw a Big Foot outside of our bathroom window in Anadarko today 4/26/12 around 12pm. It walked along the tree line and then quickly down into the Washita River. I could only see it from the waist up because of the grass being so tall but it was at least 6 feet tall and around 275 pounds if not more. It was covered in long brownish hair. I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot.

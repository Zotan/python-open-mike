8,0,East side of Prince William Sound,Valdez-Chitina-Whittier County,Alaska,,,,,1261.0,Class A,
9,1,"We were traveling westbound when the animal was sighted, standing at treeline on slight rise south of eastbound lane of highway.  We continued travel westbound several miles and pulled into a rest stop on the south side of the highway. To fix a better location we were approx. 30-45 minutes west of Alaskan/Canadian Border, westbound and several miles after seeing animal, we stopped at a rest stop on the south side of the highway. Hope this helps. Also, for what it may be worth, several local natives were having lunch there and we shared what we saw with them. I believe one worked for the state road system as he was driving a state vehicle and another mentioned he was a state sponsored hunter for rogue bear. The hunter thought I had seen a grizzly, from the coloration, the height and the lack of a neck (he reasoned that the grizzly's hump, when viewed from behind could be mistakened for a head).",Southeast Fairbanks County,Alaska,"Report 9317: Driver on Alcan Highway has noon, road encounter near Alaska-Canada border",62.9375,-141.5667,2004-06-18,9317.0,Class A,bg5q496m8b

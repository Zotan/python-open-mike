My name is Kevin and I've been hunting in Alaska for 8 years now. I'm used to tracking dangerous animals like Bull Moose and Grizzly Bears. One early morning we were observing several Large Moose tracks in the mud. I saw a track that looked like a BIG FOOT track. I looked at my buddy and said "what does that look like to you"? and He said "That's a Big Foot track"! there it was amongst the moose tracks. It was a good 11 inches long and was made from the right foot. I could see all 5 toes. What struck me most was the size of the big toe! The track appeared to be a couple of days old. I looked around for other tracks, but found none. The thing must of been running. I wanted to go back there and make a plaster cast, but it was raining hard. Two days later I went back there and the track was filled with water and nonrecognizable.

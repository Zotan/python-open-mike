My friend and I were about 11 years old. We have found some old playboy books and were sitting on a big rock in the woods looking at them, when we heard a small dead tree fall over. We look up and saw what we believe to be Bigfoot. He was about 8 or 9 feet tall and was walking horizontal to us. It was walking from right to left and was walking toward a small stream. It didn't seem to care about us, but we didn't stick around to find out. We ran out of the woods very quickly. We had a small dog with us that ran towards the creature, but later came back home with no problems. We got home and got our bb guns and a tape recorder and went back up to were we had the sighting.(I guess we thought that we were going to be famous) We found no evidence. the next day in the paper there was a front page article about footprints being found.

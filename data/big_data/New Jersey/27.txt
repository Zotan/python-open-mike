My husband and I were taking a woods cruise and were driving in the northern section of Brendan T. Byrne Forest on St Mary's road. It came to a dead end so we stopped to look around and there was a pond and a little path so we decided to walk our dog for a bit. We had only gone in a little ways when we smelled kind of musty mildew odor typically not smelled in the woods. This kind of freaked my husband out and he wanted to go back to the car. So we started back the way we came and then turned down Buckingham Whiting road. We drove this for a bit and came across a little bridge. We stopped because I like taking pictures of the water. After a bit we started to drive off. I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn't shake it. I stopped the car and husband told me to go in reverse. As we approached the area he thought he heard branches snapping and a splash into the water. He didn't see anything so we drove on. We just kept talking about what I saw and if it was a bear a deer a person. I said it was definitely on 2 legs. It was quick and it was light brown but thin. We drove a little more and turned around and went back. On our way back I thought something was rubbing in my brakes because we heard like a wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh - we stopped and he looked under my car and didn't see anything. He thought maybe it was what I saw making a warning call.

There's not much to tell but last night a friend and I where fishing Round Valley Reservoir in North Jersey from 6pm till 3am. About midnight we heard a vocalization like nothing either of us had heard before. We are both avid outdoorsmen I have hunted all around the country and never heard anything like what I heard last night, except for the Bigfoot sounds on the BFRO website, it was not very long but I could still here it, it was loud and clear.

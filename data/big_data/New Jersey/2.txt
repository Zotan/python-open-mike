Some time in early December my friend had an encounter with something he could not explain.  It took place in Mansfield, NJ in Warren County.  It was around 9:30 - 10:00 pm.  He called me up to tell me what he saw.  It turns out that on Feb. 6th I was on my way home on the same road in the same location.  It was around 10:20 pm and I was doing about 50 mph.  I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didn’t even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasn’t a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.  Everything I explained was what my friend had experienced as well.

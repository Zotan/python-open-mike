We heard the most undiscribable cry/scream ever heard,it was almost blood curdleing.it sounded about 1/4 mile or so away.All seven of us froze.We all just kind of looked at each other in disbelive,asking each other what the f--k was that,and before ya knew it it did it again,but this time it was right behind the tent. sounded like 50ft away.and if you think we froze before we were freakin now.nobody moved a muscle.turns out this sream has been heard by many researchers,and has been recorded,and this is why I am coming foward with this now.

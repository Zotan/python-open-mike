Having heard knocks and whoops between now and last spring I know we heard a scream/howl/whoop at 2 in the morning last night. My adult daughter and myself have also seen a Bigfoot crossing the road going down the side of our home. The whoop/scream last night was in our backyard. Wharton State forest is at our property line.

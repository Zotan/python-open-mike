I was driving near the town dump about 1:00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year, it was raining very hard, a large figure came out of nowhere, I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it, there was a car coming at me the other way, it almost ran into the back end of that car, it turned a little sideways to avoid the car, that's when I knew it was not a person or a bear, when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car, it was a little hunched over, its shoulders were extremely wide, I couldn't make out any facial features, it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck, it was about 6" taller than the mini van it almost ran into, if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. The whole thing only took about 2 or 3 seconds but it really shook me up. I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds, I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track, I have always had doubts about people seeing these, but now I will never doubt it again. It won't keep me from the woods but I'll keep an eye peeled from now on.

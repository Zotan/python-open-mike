Hello, I have been a believer that Big Foot exist for years just based on how many people have reported seeing or hearing something over hundreds of years.  I am 64 years old and have been hiking and camping ever since I was about 12 years old and I have seen and heard many things in the woods. On February 27, 2016, my friend Dean and I set out for an over night camping trip in Mt Washington State Forest in Mass.  You can watch the 8 min video on my blog if you like. www.hikingwithtom.com I always record our adventures on video but this time I decided to run an MP3 recorder all night and get the sounds of the night, I did get what I think was a bobcat walking up to my tent but around 2 AM I was awake again because it was very cold and hard to sleep. I was only half awake when I heard a real loud noise but not awake enough to really tell what it was except that it was a good ways off, I knew I was recording audio so I noted the time so I could find it on my recorder and went back to sleep, or at least I tried too. When I got home I found the sound on my MP3 recorder and it sounds a lot like a wood knock but judging by the amount of echo and how loud it was from so far away It had to be something real big that made that noise. I do not think even Babe Ruth could swing a bat fast and hard enough to make that sound.    The sound is int the video my blog. www.hikingwithtom.com  It sounded like it was a good half mile a way.. Thanks Tom

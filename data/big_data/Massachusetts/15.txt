October Mountain state forest, Washington, MA. October 20, 5 pm. Near camp Eagle. Loud, strong wood knocks. Long sustained low pitched howl occurring while 2 barred owls hooted back and forth. Definitely not a coyote. Sounded almost human, but very low pitch. There is no human habitation in this area and is very remote.

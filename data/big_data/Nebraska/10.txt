I had the Bigfoot sighting On the night of July 4th 1996 at about 02:00 on the actual date of the 5th.  I was on the highway 385 going South towards Hemingford.   I had just come out of the Cocrine hill section of the highway.  I was going around a sharp curve in the highway, and had my high beams on in my truck.  As I rounded the curve I saw a tall human like form take 2 or 3 steps onto the edge of the road, and then spot as if to wait for traffic to clear.  I slowed way down to see if it was someone needing a ride.  As I got next to the big foot i noticed that the creature was around 8 to 9 feet tall, and was covered head to toe in long black fur. I got scared, and being alone I stepped on the gas, and stopped 5 miles or so down the road to process what I had just seen.  The big foot also had arms that hung lower, and longer than that of humans.

It was a bright sunny summer day. My 14 year old daughter and I were on our way to pick up my 16 year old daughter. I was watching the road ahead and saw a figure cross the road from one treeline on the west side of zz to the east side treeline. We were about 800 ft . away. I ask my daughter to look and tell me what she saw, she said " Bigfoot or something like it". It looked about 7 ft. tall and 300 lbs. It had a long lope as it cleared the road in seconds and by the time we were where it had been, there was no sign, not that I stayed long. It looked like it had long hair. The next weekend my neighbor came over and mentioned that her 6yr. old granddaughter had came in the other day yelling grandma theres a monster in the field. She just brushed it off, and I never told her what we saw.

My brother and I were looking at a piece of land to lease. We were sitting in a pickup truck when we noticed something large and black about 400 yards south of us in an open field, but close to the far timberline. It appeared to be kneeling or bending over. On seeing us it stood erect on two legs, turned, and walked into the timber disappearing from sight.

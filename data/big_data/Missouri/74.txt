I am 70 years old and have only started to tell a few people ...They either say I am lying or don't know what I saw...they just laugh..I used to drive truck and have seen lots of wild life..I have been in 48 states and lots of Canada. My son has seen them down by the lake..table rock, cape fair area.. he hunts and fishes a lot..

While birding the James Reed Wildlife area in Lee's Summit Missouri in the late afternoon of March 8, 2013, I observed in the tree line on the west side of of Bodarc Lake a large brown hairy creature walking along the edge of the Lake. It appeared to be 7ft tall and had a long stride and arm swing. I observed this for five minutes from the parking lot for this lake. I observed this animal with my binoculars.  The animal walked into the woods. The area has cut back the brush in the area opening large areas to view that have been obscured for many years.

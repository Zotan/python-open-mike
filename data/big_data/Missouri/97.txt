Myself and 3 friends went to a game access area close to Smithville Lake where myself and several other young men had witnessed a pair of red eyes looking at us in October or November of 2011. Myself and the 3 friends went back to the game access in May of 2012 late at night, close to 11 or 12. We walked around for a little while and didn't hear anything so we went back to the jeep and waiting with the windows cracked. We stayed there quietly chatting for around an hour or an hour and a half, then we felt a strange feeling and decided to leave. The driver turned the car on and the passenger pointed and screamed. Off the front of the car about 30 yards was a large figure squatted down looking at us with red eyes. The driver attempted to turn around and almost hit the creature in his frenzy of getting turned around. Myself and the passenger, as i was sitting behind the passenger, got within 7 or 8 feet of the creature through the window. The face still haunts me to this day and I have trouble writing about it these 6 years on. It was much more human like than I ever would have guessed. Simply horrifying and still gives me nightmares. It all happened in a span of 10 - 15 seconds by the time the driver got us out of there. One of the guys still will not speak about it.

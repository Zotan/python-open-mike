I believe to have a very large creature that comes and goes off my property of 50 acres just outside of city of Eldon. Part of my property has unusual broken over trees as well as what appears to be small dens where cedar trees are pulled over and bent to the ground with other limbs busted and placed on top of cedars many new breaks of cedars and other large shrubs in same area have appeared this summer in same area of property. My family and I as well as our neighbors have heard wood knocks come from that area. My son and I were both spooked by a very loud roar like noise one evening, and one night seen a large creature moving through the field. March 2017 Update: My wife and I had just put our boys to bed and returned to the living room to watch TV about 10 minutes later our dog started barking in an aggressive manner on porch which got my attention as well as my boys who got out of bed . I invited our dog inside house and took my spot light out and I came across a large set of orange glowing eyes at least 8 foot off the ground. I motioned for my wife to come out to look at it my oldest boy came out with her. We watched for at least 2 minutes or a little longer as it would look from behind the oak it was trying to hide behind. I began yelling at it saying things like we see you then it ran catching it's full side view. Nothing else unusual however my wife boy and myself were very startled at the size and speed of it as it ran away. We commented to one another about the size of it's arms very massive. Cold clear night around 10:30.

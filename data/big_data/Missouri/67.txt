I was driving east on hillsboro hematite rd. to go mushroom hunting. Coming into a curve to my left I noticed what I first thought was a person, as I got closer I saw that it was not a person but a large hump shoulderd black animal shuffleing across the road to north side.                                                       It was taller than first thought 6 foot est. and it started running into a cedar tree thicket. It swung arms back and forth as it walked like a ape, I stopped the car where it crossed and rolled down my window and turned off my engine and tryed to hear it going away but heard no sounds.                                                     Went to mushroom hunting spot and did not stop at site on the way home as I felt it would be taking a chance.

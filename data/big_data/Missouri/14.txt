While laying down and preparing to go to sleep we heard foot prints coming our way from within the woods. Not knowing what it was I grabbed a handful of chat from the ground and threw it in the direction of the steps. The creature took a number of steps back into the woods. Then it stopped and started coming back towards us. It was a two legged creature. You could tell it was walking on two legs. At that point we both got up and ran to the car. We then drove back and forth returning to gather what we could off of the ground and we left the area. At this point we drove back to the highway and to a roadside park where we spent the rest of the night in the car. The next morning we went back, restarted our fire from the night before, I prepared breakfast, eggs and bacon. After cleaning up the dishes we began walking the trail [ Mark Twain National Forest ]. Approximately 1 mile in we stopped at a spring I knew about to get a drink and fill our canteens and continue down the trail which followed a creek. After walking another mile or so I heard a noise coming from our right, I looked to my right and then I saw it. Up the wooded hill I saw a reddish long haired man type of creature, approximately 7-8 foot tall running through the woods. I was able to see it for around 5 steps before it cleared the top of the hill and disappeared. At this point I turned to the girl I was with and asked her if she saw it. She said no but at this point I was ready to go and she didn't argue with me and we walked back down the trail to her car and we left. I got no argument from her. She was with me the night before when we heard it outside our camp. I was dating another girl who I eventually married, the girl I was with was not her. I was a JR in high school at the time.

I was riding a four wheeler at my aunts out in the country. On an old gravel road I saw something that appeared to be a dog two-hundered yards ahead of me in a corn feild on my right side.  As I got closer I could tell it was not a dog but a man-like creature. It stood up from a kneel  and ran to the middle of the road it then turned to look at me and ran into the woods I gasped and set for a second. Then I turned arround and road off in fear it might come back.

When I was living in Brixey, Missouri I lived out in the country. We had woods all around us and the houses were all spaced out. We had a good size pond in our yard and a lot of deer and other animals came through to drink from the pond. One night me and my now ex-husband were asleep. It was the middle of the night when I was woken up by the sound of my rabbit that was in a big dog kennel on the porch that was covered, to keep the rabbit from the cold. The kennel was right outside the front door and under a window.  Where my bed was I had a clear view of the front door and the window. When I woke there was a big dark figure in the window. It looked big and hairy. I don't know what it was but I do know it was not a dog, coyote, a deer or a bear. My two dogs that I had there, that I still have, will bark at everything, but didn't bark. One was laying on the sofa like she was trying to hide, something she has never done before and hasn't done since that night. I now live in Texas and I would really like to know if you guys have ever got reports out of Missouri or if I'm the first one. I don't know what it was for sure but I think it was a Bigfoot.

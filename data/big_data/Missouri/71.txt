I was in the woods with my friend, it was 6:29pm, and the ground was wet. From 10 yards (or so) away between two trees a blackish figure (8 feet tall) moved and I saw it directly for only a split second. The cat we were with was on a tree stump near by and was looking right by where we saw it and her hair was all puffed up. Then we heard two splashes together (it crossed a puddle). Then the neighbor's dogs ran up to the fence (out of sight) and one barked, then the sound was repeated but in a more girthy tone, and then it was repeated over and over again on different sides of the lake. then everything got louder and very intense and we heard a cow moo from across the lake and they don't have any cows, then we went inside.

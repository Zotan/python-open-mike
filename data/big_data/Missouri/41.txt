Creature crossed small two lane paved road in front of vehicle late afternoon. No other vehicles in area, low volume road. Creature did not stop, but continued to cross the road and enter wooded area. My father is the witness, he described creature as tall, hairy {different shades of hair}, long arms, ape shaped face, with large stride, but almost limping.

Hello I live off grid inside Goose Creek Lake north of Farmington, MO. Its actually French Village, MO. but inside Goose Creek Lake community. And I am on the north side of Goose Creek Lake, Stone Horse Lane. Last night 04/13/2017 I had just turned off my generator for a peaceful night of nature while I sleep. As I laid in bed I noticed that all the crickets, birds, frogs all stopped sounding or making noise. After about 20 or so minutes I heard what sounded like tree knocks but it was just one knock and I did not hear a reply. The direction in which I heard this sound was right next door on another lot beside mine. I thought to myself was that just what I thought it was a tree knock. I became frightened and I could hear my neighbors shed creak like something big pushed against it. I heard this for several minutes then it went silent again and still no sounds of any birds, crickets etc. The only reason I know it was a tree knock is because I've studied bigfoot since I was a kid, watching stories etc. Then I started hearing russling sounds coming from next door on same side I heard the knock come from. I could hear something pressing against the gravel driveway they have over there. At one time I thought I heard a growl and chewing sounds. After a terrifying hour or so I could hear what ever it was walking but it did not sound like a person, a animal walking. After a few minutes I heard a whooping sound but I did not hear a reply to it. I would appreciate it if someone can call me maybe come out here because today I went looking for signs of what it could have been and found a foot print in the gravel road just feet from where I heard all the noise the night before. I also took it upon myself and took pictures of the print with a tape measure. I then called security about the matter and they came out and I showed Randy the foot print. It measured 17" by 6" I am concerned that I may be in danger.

around july-2004 my self and some friends were camping at Rocky Fork Lake in Cloumbia, Mo. we were standing around a camp fire and were proceeding to cookup some dinner when something came from the south side of our site. it sounded like a huge animal. it ran past our site..it came as close as 6-8 feet of us. it circled us three times and then ran to the lake front . it made a whaling  sound from the water area. it was a high pitch howl that sounded as it was attacking something. it sounded as a pig squealing. it ran behind us.

I was driving home on Carol Park Rd (south, off of Hwy 30) at approx 11:00 pm. I traveled about 200 feet south of Hwy 30 and was changing radio stations, when I looked up as I "caught" a glimpse of an "upright type" of animal, cross Carol Park Rd, from west to east. That area is heavily wooded on both sides. It is an area where the road runs thru the top part of a deep ravine, that leads down to a watershed (creek). I was pretty surprised, and told my wife when i got home. We both just shrugged it off. It wouldn't surprise either of us, at all, if it actually was a bigfoot. There is lots of wildlife in the area.

IN MAY 1970 MY BUDDY AND I WERE RIDING IN HIS 1957 WILLIES JEEP IN THE W&O RAILROAD TRACK IN PURCELLVILLE, VA ABOUT TEN PM WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE BIPEDAL ANIMAL CROSSING THE TRACKS APROX 70 TO 100 YARDS IN FRONT OF US. IT TOOK ABOUT THREE STEPS TO CLEAR APPOX. 30 FT FROM SHOULDER TO SHOULDER ACROSS THE TRACKS. THE ANIMAL LOOKED ROUGHLY 7 TO 8 FEET TALL, COVERED IN REDISH GREY HAIR. IT HAD LONG ARMS, LONG LEGS, BROAD SHOULDERS, AND NO DISERNABLE NECK. AS IT GLANCED A LOOK AT OUR VEHICLE I COULD TELL THE CREATURES FACE WAS APE LIKE IN NATURE. THIS ALL HAPPENED VRY FAST. MY BUDDY AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHR IN ASTONISHMENT, SLAMMED THE JEEP IN REVERSE, AND GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE!

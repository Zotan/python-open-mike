This report was originally submitted by email and later investigated by telephone. "I am a former United States Marine who in 2008 had a very compelling sighting of what can only be discribed as a Bigfoot. I am willing to tell my story once I am contacted and also I have two other US Marines that saw the same being. I can assure you that I am 100 percent honest with what I saw and that I can provide proof of my credentials and location."

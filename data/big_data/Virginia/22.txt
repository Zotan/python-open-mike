It was about 5:30 in the morning and I was driving to work.  About 20 feet in front of me I saw a massive (at least 8 foot tall and very broad in the chest) creature walking across the road.  It was covered in hair, walking on two legs and crossed the road in two steps and walked into the woods. I stopped my truck to see if I could hear anything in the woods, but did not.

My wife and I were driving to Indianapolis to see our parents. It was around 10:30 PM when we saw a large creature cross the interstate. It crossed about 200-300 yards in front of our car from the left to the right. It seemed to take about four steps to cross three lanes of interstate highway. The creature looked exactly like the bigfoot in the Patterson film. My wife and I both said did you see that? We were driving about 60 miles an hour and by the time we traveled the distance to the bigfoot crossing it had crossed the road and was gone. It was nighttime and the creature was illuminated by the oncoming traffic.

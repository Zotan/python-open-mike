It was bow season in October 1992, around 5:30 in the evening. I had just climed out of my deer stand and heard movement about 20 meters in front of my stand. So I decided to just sit at the base of the tree to see if if the deer would come out of the brush, and hopefuly get a shot at it. After waiting for about 10 minutes it got pretty dark in the woods. Too dark to take a shot, so instead of spooking the deer, I decided to wait for it to move out so that I might have another chance at it the next day. It was making alot of noise, kind of unusual for deer. I must have set there for another 20 minutes when I heard this loud high pitch scream, or howl. It lasted for about 3-4 seconds and it was very close to my left. Needless to say, it scared the crap out of me! I have never heard anything like that before! I grew up around the woods and I have been hunting for many years, and never heard that sound before or since. I have been in the military for 16 years and spent my share of many different types of wilderness, and this sound that I heard I will never forget.

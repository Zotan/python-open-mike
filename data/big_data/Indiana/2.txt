When I was a little girl,before i'd heard of bigfoot , i saw in a small woods down from our house what i called a big white hairy thing. it was in the mid seventies....in INDIANA. I've never reported it to anyone other than my family who were witness to my subsequent hysteria. The big white hairy thing was a beige white color  with a cone head sloping back from it's brow ridge.Short hair over its entire visable body ecept for its hands and face longer hair like a cloak over its shoulders.It was june or july...summer time...it's face was brown like leather its eyes peircing black ...a broad flat nose... it was eating blackberries from the bushes...it must have felt me looking at him because it turned to look at me and when it saw I saw him he took two large steps into the wood and disappeared. That's when I screamed.Being only a small child no one really believed me or tried to tell me it must have been someone in a coat. I've never forgotten it. He didn't seem menacing at all but it really freaked my little self out.

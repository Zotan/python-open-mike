I am reporting a sasquatch seen crossing the road at night; seen very well by the headlights. It ran erect. It had long arms and was massive in size in comparison to a man. When it reached the steep (empty) canal bank it used it's arms like legs, knuckles down, like a quadruped, to swifty climb the embankment. We returned to my sister house in Dryfork canyon by the Remember the Maine Park the next day for my mother's birthday. We told a few people what we had seen the night before. My sister began to ask some neighbors if they had seen a sasquatch. Some of the neighbors knew about other sightings in the area.

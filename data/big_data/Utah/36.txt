On a recent backpack trip in the Marsh Peak/Twin Lake area of the High Uintahs in Utah I and several others in the party noticed the obvious lack of small birds, chipmunks, deer and other small wild life. On the morning of the second day shortly after our camp became active with the days preparation for more hiking we heard whooping sounds coming from up the trail where we assumed there was another group of hikers.  The whoops matched one sound bites found on this web sight.  As it turns out we were the only group hiking in that area at that time as we found no trace of other visitors in the area during our time there.

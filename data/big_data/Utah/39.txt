I was hiking in the Wasatch mountains above the town of Pleasent Grove, Utah. I had just entered Grove Creek Canyon when I saw a large red animal up on the rim of the canyon, about 100 feet above me. It looked about as tall as a large man. There was little wind, but I did not notice any strange smell. I quickly realized that I was looking at a Bigfoot. I stood and observed the animal for about 5 seconds, then it walked away from the rim of the canyon, out of view. I looked for it throughout the rest of the hike but I did not see it again. It appeared to be looking east, up the canyon and into the small valley between the foothills, where we were, and Mt.Timpanogos. After I had watched it, it turned it's back to me and walked out of view. I can only guess that it was looking for prey. This occured sometime between 3:00pm-4:00pm in May of 1996.

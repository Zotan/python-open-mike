It was early in the morning 12:30 to 1:00 A.m It was Jan of 2005, I was plowing snow on US 89 Through Logan Canyon, I was in my truck plowing snow I was near the Franklin Basin Road and saw something in the road. I flipped on the plow lights (now these lights are landing lights) they are very bright and I saw something walk across the road. It was large, Tall, and hairy it stood about 7 ft tall. It looked right at me.and continued to walk across the road. I didn't stop cuz of the snowy conditions. When I stopped back in the morning all tracks were covered in new snow. What sealed the sighting for me was that morning on the radio I heard of someone reporting a sighting up cub river in Idaho. The Franklin Basin Road connects Logan canyon To Cub river in Idaho. My family thinks I'm nuts but I know what I saw It was not man. I hope this helps.

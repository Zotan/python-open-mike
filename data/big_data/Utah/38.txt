I was hunting on the second weekend of the deer hunt and I planned on spending the night alone on the top of Y Mountain. When I arrived at the top I found to my surprise that someone was up there this year ( I was shocked that any person would have hiked to this remote location). I followed the foot prints to where they were going because they were going to the valley overlook... as I was walking it was much easier to step into the tracks of the person (the snow was about 1 foot deep)... as I did this I was shocked at the size of the man I was trying to step into the foot steps of..... I almost could not take such huge steps... as the foot prints went under the shadow of the evergreen tree I saw what shocked me.... the foot print were bare foot!!!!!!!!! I could see toe prints clearly!!!! at fist I could not believe it and I looked again and again and measured them and looked at more thinking I was going crazy ....... I got scared and the hair on my neck stood up!!!!!!!!!!! It was very very spooky!!!! and I was alone and going to spend the night with this animal..... I decided to leave imediately.... As I was leaving the mountain I saw more foot prints on the south side of the mountain going down into Rock Canyon.

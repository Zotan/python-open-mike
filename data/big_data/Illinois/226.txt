As I was performing my regular pest control service to facility, I found trails of what looked like big prints with what looks like toe imprints. I took pictures along with a video segment. Try to follow the print but lost it due to trail ending in patches where no snow was on ground. I didn't see any thing visually as far as animal or human at time of finding but I have seen deer, jack rabbits and coyotes in these areas. Note: I would love to forward video and pics...

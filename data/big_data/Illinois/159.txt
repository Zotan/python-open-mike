I was walking through the woods and I sat down on a fallen down tree and to my left I hear a strange grunting noise. I was frightened I called my dad and had him come to meet me in the woods. A few weeks before my dad was out feeding the animals when he heard a strange screaming voice from the other side of the creek.

I live in Freeport, Illinois in a trailer pk. I was out bow hunting in my timber I own. I got up in my tree stand about 6:50 a.m. while it was still dark, hoping a deer would come in right at light. I heard something come up under my tree, and it was breathing real hard. I thought it was a big deer at first, it stood at the base of my tree a good 10 minutes and left to my south-east. I could hear it walking away. About 7:10 to 7:15 am it was foggy, not real bad, a light fog, real thin. It was about 50 degrees out and fairly light by now. I have good eyes and looking for deer, when I noticed this big human like figure. It was about 100 yards away from me.  It walked to the east at a fast pace. I think it heard me go to my tree-stand. It knew I was in the tree. It acted like it was scared, I think I was more terrified when I heard its breathing under my tree then when I saw it walking. I tell my friends, and they think I am nuts. I'm not, I know when I see something like that, I did not believe in big-foot until I seen it that morning. I also seen large foot-prints in certain areas but never told anyone. I seen them for about 2 years after my sighting. Thank you.

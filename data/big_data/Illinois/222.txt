My wife, daughter and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road no more than 50 feet in front of us. This thing cleared the road in not even two steps. The arm on this thing was long and extremely large. I found some interesting information which leads me to believe they use the forest preserves to move from west to east and vice versa..my heart literally jump this time because it walked directly in front of us and all three of us saw it. Now my wife and I know that we are definitely not crazy.

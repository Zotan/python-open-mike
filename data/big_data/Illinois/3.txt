I was about 16 or 17 yrs old. My family lived along the Rock River. My parents and sister had gone shopping and I was home alone. We had a dachshund and a mixed breed that started to go nuts around 7 p.m. I let them out and they took off towards the pasture. I had grabbed my shotgun thinking it was someone trying to steal something. The dogs took off towards the edge of the river and stopped. I looked where they were looking and saw a hairy humanoid figure. There was big footprints in the snow from the pasture to the river.

I was coming home from work, heading from Albion towards Fairfield, which would have been about 11:30 that night. It was near Red Hill Road. I started smelling something first, I had my window down, it was a little warm. I thought what in the devil is that! And  all of a sudden I saw this huge, huge figure off to the side of the road, between  the ditch and the field. It was walking east towards Albion. It stopped and I just went. I don't know why it stopped. I was about 120 feet from it. It scared the crap out of me, I said what the heck is that. It is walking upright, it wasn't no coyote or wolf, we don't have bears up there that I know of, I grew up there. That was the one I seen on the way home from work.

I was hunting on me and my neighbor's property it was right before daylight. I could hear something coming through the woods so I figured it was a deer as it got closer the sound sounded more like somebody walking through the woods. Finally I seen what it was it was a massive black figure had to be 7 or so feet tall it walked slowly and turned its head when it was walking, it stopped looked at me then it took off in massive strides. This animal had broad shoulders and it was walking on two feet. I was terrified but after the hunt that morning I went to where I seen it about 15 yards in buckbrush there was trees as big around as a PVC pipe pushed over. I don't know what I saw but it was nothing I've ever seen in my entire life and it made me think that there's something out there. I always heard of the legends but I never thought much about it until that day.

my experience happened back in 1985 or 6. a friend of mine his little brother dad and my dog were out hunting. i used to take the dog huntin everything. my friend and i were on a hill looking down into a revine that joined another revine. his brother and dad were on the other side by at about a mile the dog was in between us just going mad barking and kept coming closer to me and my freind. all the sudden we look down where these two revines meet and there is big (little) foot. he looked at us. we looked at him he took two steps and was gone back up the revine he just came out of. i asked my friend if he seen that. he said yes. i asked was it about 4-5 feet tall he said yes. i asked was it covered in hair he said yes. then he said dont tell anyone because they will think we are crazy. i didnt even tell his dad or brother until after he died now im telling everyone. i dont care if u think im crazy i know what i saw. i called i little foot though because it didnt look that t tall only 4 -5 feet. but looking back we was looking down into a revine about 100 yards and things look smaller when u are looking down on them. thankyou

I was deer hunting in Washington county Illinois on private land. I dont own the land but my family is the only one that hunts it. Ive been hunting the exact same tree since I started hunting the property about 17 years ago. Im on a hill on the edge of a field. Field is behind me Im looking west. It is early November still leaves on the tree but some have fallen so I could still see thru the woods somewhat. I dont remember the exact time of day but it was early evening several hours before sunset. I look north towards the edge of field I see a dark figure walking down the edge of the field, I thought it was a tresspasser walking to go hunt. I was starting to start to get down from my stand to see what the person was doing on private land. Off to my right (north) I hear something walking in the large ravine at this point the figure was about 60 yards heading west up the ravine. As Im looking thur the woods I can tell its not a person in camo it was black I cant ID what it was but it was on 2 legs I would say by my best guess it was the size of a large man.

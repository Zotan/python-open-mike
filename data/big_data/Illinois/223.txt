I have pictures of a foot print and a hand print that I took in the forest preserve that is on the east side of my town. The foot print in my opinion based on the size of my husband's shoe size would be a man's size 12 shoe. It was taken in July of 2008. The other picture is a hand print and was really large, twice the size of my husbands hand and he has large hands. It was taken in June of 2009. I have found prints over a number of years. These were the clearest.

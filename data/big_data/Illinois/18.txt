About ten years ago I saw something very peculiar. It was laying in the middle of the road and I didn't notice it until I was about to hit it. As my ex-girlfriend and I swerved to the left lane to go around, it got up and watched us drive around it. This thing was HUGE! I'm not exaggerating it had to be close to ten feet tall, with white to grayish colored fur. I watched it watch us drive away in my rearview for about a minute then it ran away on it's legs just like a human. At that time and for a few years after I was in sort of a denial, telling myself it had ot be some kind of Polar Bear that had gotten loose form a local zoo or something. After never hearing any news story about a missing Polar Bear I put in the back of my mind always suspicioning that it may have been a Bigfoot. As for my ex-girlfriend (the other witness), I haven't spoke to her in years but I know that she saw it too, and was just as dumbfounded as I am!

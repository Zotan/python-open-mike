Well I was going towards Beall Woods State Park in my car. A normal trip but one I really didn't think I needed to go for a run this night. But I had to so I drove out to my site and that is where I saw him on E 1020 N as big as life itself. I saw him for about a minute or two, it was at least 9' 6" tall and 60" wide, he had two fingers missing from one hand because he kinda turned and shielded his eyes for a moment then ran off as he did. To this very day I have not been back there since.

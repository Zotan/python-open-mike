I work nights, and was riding my motorcycle home (Marseilles, IL) from work. At about 1 am I turned from Illinois Rt 71 south onto Marseilles road. Immediately after the turn there are 2 sharp curves in the road. I down shifted into 2nd gear as I approached the first curve. When down shifting my pipes become quite loud and often pop. As I began the turn in an instant I saw a large figure standing near the edge of the corn along side the road (to my right). Quickly it leaned slightly forward and made a loud higher pitched sound, almost like a scream, or a call. Looking back I would consider that perhaps my pipes scared it. This scream was incredibly loud and echoed, it was so close I honestly hit the throttle and started screaming myself. I came to the second curve, too scared to look in my mirror I took the curve a bit quick and briefly heard the scream again. In all honesty I hit the throttle and didn't look back.

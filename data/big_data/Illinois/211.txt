I spoke with the witness by phone. In summary: • The animal was 7 feet tall. • The animal was very hairy and beefy in appearance. • The hair was dark brown. • The animal was very close to the car, perhaps 30 feet. • The animal was very well lit by the headlights of the vehicle. • The animal as it came out of the ditch was initially on all fours and then stood up on two legs and walked away. • Although there are no large woods in the immediate area there are wooded creeks. • The waterway is known as the Upper Salt Fork Drainage Ditch.

My sister recalled a day sighting roughly 5 pm across from our home, in the strip mines.  This was roughly 20 years ago.  She was riding a small motorcycle down a rock road, she came over the hill to look at the mine lake.  What she thought was a man was squatted sifting water with his hands.  When it heard the motorcycle it turned and took off very quickly and uncharacteristically fast towards her.  She turned and left as quickly as she could.  She didn't notice the body but the face had a large amount of white hair with a rough expression, the movement was very quick and bounding.  When she glanced back it was gone.  My dad went over to see if he saw any signs of someone staying there and there was nothing.  Come to find out there are many sightings in our area of something called the "silver creek freak".

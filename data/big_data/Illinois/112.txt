I was driving down Dupont road which y's off at Seneca bridge to go under towards Marseilles and just before turning right onto Main street I seen something??? all I know is I said "what the hell is that" it was yesterday aug 12,2015 at approx 11:20 a.m. greyish tan in color 7 or 8 feet tall long gaping strides while crossing the road I know exactly the spot. I am a non believer so this really is hard to take in.

My friend and I were driving home in the evening. As we came around the corner we observed a large upright animal standing in the middle of the road.  It took several steps and went into the woods. It was grayish-black in color and stood about 7 feet tall. I couldn't see the face very well because it was covered with hair. My friend said she didn't believe in such a thing as bigfoot but I told her "well, it was standing right in front of us."

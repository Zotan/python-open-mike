My brother's wife said a very large hairy thing walked out of a ditch and across in front of her car one Sunday afternoon.This took place on Illinois Rt. 48 by the South Fork of the Sangamon River bridge. She stated that this thing stepped over a guard rail like it was nothing and walked off into the timber.

While driving my work van just as I was coming over the top of the hill (over pass) a tall dark figure passed in the tree line. It was walking too tall for a human. It was maybe 7 to 8 foot range because it was at the mid point of the trees. There isn't a rise there it's flat I checked because I drive this way 5 days a week twice a day. I watched it walk for several seconds until it disappeared into thicker tree growth. Was stopped due to bridge construction (flagman).

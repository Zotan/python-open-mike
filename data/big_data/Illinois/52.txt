(#1) late July - early August 1968 (#2) 11 August 1968, 8:30 P.M. (#3) 12 - 18 August 1968 (#1) Residents in the area reported dogs barking louding and "carrying on" at night. (#2) Tim Bullock, 22, of West Frankfort, and his girlfriend, Barbara Smith, 17, of Carterville, sighted a "creature" while riding northeast of Chittyville.  Bullock reported the creature threw dirt at them through the window.  Smith saw it and started screaming.  She described it as "huge" -  about 10 feet tall, with a head as large as a steering wheel.  It appeared to be black, with a round "hairy" face.  They left the area and reported the incident to police.  Bullock returned the next day and found a depression in the grass, as if a large animal had rested or slept there. (#3) Bullock said a carhop at a Herrin drive-in restaurant told him that someone came into the drive-in "hysterical" and said they had seen the creature.  One other person reported they saw "it" near Rt. 148.

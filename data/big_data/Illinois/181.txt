My wife and I on several nights have heard a sound just like the recordings. On every occasion our dog growls like she is ready to kill someone. On every occasion it goes on for a few minutes and then stops. On every occasion coyotes start to howl almost as soon as it starts. Whatever it was it seems to not be so frequent, but now that I have heard what you say is a bigfoot on your website I will make sure NOT to investigate it..

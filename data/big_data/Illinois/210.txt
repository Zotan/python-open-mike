I noticed that when we passed by the "chicken house" that the chickens were not out and about as usual.  Then I noticed a medium size dog running very quickly down the road towards us. Then on the drivers side of the road I saw an animal that was all black standing by a tree.  It was barely 5 feet tall.  At the time I saw it.  I said nothing about it to my husband.  It was standing by the tree and it just disappeared.  I though that no real animal could just disappear like a ghost into the forest.  But since then I have seen deer disappear just like that into the forest.  So I don't doubt that what I saw was an animal.  It appeared to be a animal with black fur not very tall only 5 foot.  It was standing up like a human.  It appeared to be very shy. Like I said I have not said much about this to anyone.  My husband and I are native americans and we have a great respect for animals.  We know that some of our people belive bigfoot to be a spiritual being not a physical being.  But the dog seemed to be running from it very quickly.

I was sitting in my deer stand at 10 in the morning. I heard something going through the brush and observed a solid black 8 foot tall animal walking across a small clearing. It walked 30 to 40 feet to get through the clearing and it was 40 yards from my deer stand. It was muscular with broad shoulders. As I was in my deer stand and did not make any sounds I don't believe it knew I was there and it never looked in my direction.

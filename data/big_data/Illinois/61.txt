This happened to a friend of mine. It happened in the late 1970's when a friend of mine while running his traps along a small strip-mine pond  noticed a line of very large, bare-foot, humanlike footprints in the mud along the receded water line of the pond. He didn't think much of it at the time but he did think it was rather unusual that someone would be walking around barefoot in the middle of the mine spoils in December. I kind of find this to be odd myself. He has told he has heard some loud screams while coon hunting at night before but just passed it off as Screech Owls except for once when he heard one very close and it scared his dogs and him enough to pack up and go home.

My pitbull was barking in terror. I went out to check on him and shone my light just on the other side of the fence I put up around the orchard and he was standing there clear as day staring at the dog and me . Twenty yards away. Flat face. Reddish brown fur. Eyes looked orange in the light.  He disappeared into the woods. I've seen him many times. I live surrounded by the national forest.

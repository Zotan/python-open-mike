I WAS CROSSING THE RAILROAD TRACKS HEADING SOUTH, AND WHEN I LOOKED TO THE WEST OF THE TRACKS WHILE CROSSING, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A BIGFOOT CROSSING THE TRACKS HEADING NORTH. IT WAS TALL, HAD DARK HAIR (LOOKED KIND OF LONG OR SHAGGY)...ONE ARM SWAYING BACK AND FORTH AS IT WALKED. I LIKE FLEW HOME AND LOCKED MY DOOR...I WAS REALLY SCARED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!!! TOLD MY HUSBAND ABOUT IT LATER THAT DAY, HE THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.

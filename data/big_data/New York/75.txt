I was out hunting when I saw a creature that I thought was a bear.  Then a second, much smaller creature that I realized was a bigfoot, come out of the brush.  I shot at them with my bow to scare them, and the larger one, which must have been 8-8.5 feet tall picked up the smaller one and placed it on its back and walked, not ran, away.  I then quickly packed up and ran to the UTV I was using.

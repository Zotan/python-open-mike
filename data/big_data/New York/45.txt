Witness received a text message from a friend at 10pm. He needed vehicle assistance. As he was driving Eastbound, towards Vermont, on US 4, he noticed a "Log" on the side of the road where the white line is. Witness then noticed a second log next to the other. He then realized it was a black haired creature, approximately 6 foot tall, 2.5-3 foot wide shoulders. No neck, the hair from the head went down to the shoulders. He only saw the back of the creature, he did not see the face or front. As he approached, he saw it step over a side railing about 3 feet high with little effort and descend into the woods towards a high power line. He had to continue to assist his friend. The next day he contacted a local Whitehall Bigfoot researcher Paul Bartholomew whom visited the site with the witness and took plaster casts of the two footprints on the side of the road.

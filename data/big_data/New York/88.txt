well here is my sighting. on june 20th 2004, [near] rochester [and] greece, me and 2 friends where out on a bike ride like we do three times a week. we start at 104 and fetzner rd in rochester new york and travel down the bike trail too the [parkway] and iland cottage rd. we always stop at the pond and [our] bike rides are well into the night around 12 - 1 am. we hang out for a while then head back home. what would make it a 15 - 20 mile bike ride. while standing talking we all noticed something standing behind tree. it was about 7 - 8 feet tall tan in color or gray fur. it stood out in the black background. one of my friends start[ed] heading towards it and so did the other and then me with my headlight. when the first friend moved the thing started off too the woods on 2 feet. my one friend said he seen it turn around and look at him. i just seen it go into woods. when we got too the woods which woul be heading west next too parkway, one went in a little. me and other stayed on edge. we stood still and heard alot branches and then silence. don’t know if it was related too [our] sighting but seemd like the only sorce at the time because [of] what was seen. it was pretty chilling and strange. felt very weird like it wasn’t happening.

Myself and my soon to be fiancé were having a bonfire on her 87 acre beef farm and we were playing Native American music when we both heard tree knocks and vocal “whoops” coming from in front and behind us......we both feel very strongly that we do have a squatch on this property not 1 but possibly 3 She had an encounter when she was a much younger girl here on the farm and heard stories from her father about staying away from the back field at night.....there’s a lotta history here on this farm and as it is one of the last real farms left here in upstate New York Update: As I’m typing this at July 3 10:22am I just heard a very large tree knock followed by a sound of a crashing tree!!!

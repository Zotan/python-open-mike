It was about 130 in the morning and me and a buddy were driving up to Caroga lake on rt 29 when my headlights caught something crossing the road in the distance. When we got close enough to see whatever it was crossed the guard rail like it wasn’t even there and proceeded to walk into the woods. I couldn’t tell what color it was but it was big we went back the next day and my buddy who is 6’2 tried to cross the guard rails and he had trouble doing it so I would have to say it was at least 7 feet tall. Twice around the same area a couple of years apart we heard a loud whirling sound like we’ve never heard before.

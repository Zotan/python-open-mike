We were returning home from Pratt. Heading east on highway 54 approximately 5 miles we saw a creature about 200 yards south of the highway,standing upright. It was maybe 9 or 10 feet tall. This was at about 1:30 pm. It was looking back towards the highway as we passed it then ran southeast towards a stand of trees. I estimate its stride at about 5 or 6 feet at a liesurely gate. Telling my wife and daughter what i was seeing my wife looked over and saw the same thing I did.

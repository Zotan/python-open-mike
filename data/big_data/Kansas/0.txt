Recently was sitting at computer at 6:00 am.  No one else was up in the house and no lights on in the neighborhood.  Loud whoop in my back yard never heard this sound before. Very loud I was in the house early morning no one else up.  My house is very sound limited from the outside this was very loud.  Got up looked out on my deck too dark to see anything sounded like it was in my backyard.  never saw anything or heard anything like this before.  i'm an outside person very observent and know animals in my area have seen couger, fox and deer in my area.

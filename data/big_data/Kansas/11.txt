Was fishing at Ottowa county lake near Bennington happened to look over to the south by the dam and saw a huge upright creature towering above the tall grass it was right next to a tree the lowest branches on that particular tree are about 10 ft from the ground the head was right below that branch  I saw the head and shoulders of it my name is James I'm in the military and I know i saw a bigfoot.

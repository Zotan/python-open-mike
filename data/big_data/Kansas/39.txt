Back in 2004 my boyfriend and I were driving around at night. We were near Murdock Kansas on a dirt road when we seen something running up along the fence line. It was grayish white and about 8 ft tall. I turned the car around to see if it was still there and it was gone. I have always joked that it was bigfoot never knowing that there had been sightings in Kansas.

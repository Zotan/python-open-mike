Me and my dad went to Kendall Lake in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park on May 24, 2015 around 1:00AM. We were doing calls and we heard this very long whoop. Sounded like a scream! It was the most scariest sound I have ever heard. It was weird because the call I got back sounded a lot like Matt Moneymaker's recording he got back in the 90's in Ohio. We went back June 6th around the same time and we heard the same whoop back! It was scary even though we heard it before.

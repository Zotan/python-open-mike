My family and I were on our way back from Chauncey, Ohio visiting a friend.  We were on Route 13 just about four miles south of Moxahala, Ohio.  I had to go to the bathroom real bad so I pulled off a access point.  I got out leaving the car running so the kids would not be afraid.  I had just walked around the car to go.  I heard a bunch of noise in the woods near the car and to look up and see a face looking out at me.  It was like a big type of face almost like a sunflower is my first thought.  It was only six to eight feet away from me.  It was a light colored brown when looking at it in the car lights.  I froze and thought for a moment was it there before?.... the answer was no!  When I saw it the sounds had stopped.  I ran around the car and we sped away.  I told the kids and they believed me because they felt the hair on there necks stand up like I had.  It was about 12:30 AM in the morning.

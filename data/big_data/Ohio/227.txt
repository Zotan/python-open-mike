I was about 8 years old, I believe it was fall. Everyone was asleep in bed and I had woken up to a noise at the window. We had no curtains on the windows and we lived in a trailer deep in the country surrounded by woods. When I looked out the window I seen a large figure looking at me through  the window. I was so scared that I was unable to speak or scream, or even move. When I finally was able to get the courage to go to my parents room I could not say a single word. I ran back to my bed and hid under the blankets until morning. The next morning I told my parents and when they looked outside there were indentations in the ground in front of the window. They then decided to look online and seen there were more sightings in the general area. They showed me a picture and asked if that was what I had seen, and it was indeed a Bigfoot.

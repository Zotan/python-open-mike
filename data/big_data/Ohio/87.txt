So I was with five of my friends fly fishing and when we pulled in we noticed an almost dead silence. So we go along the trail to our spot we always fish at do to the large amount of bass we have caught down there. So as we were walking my rod snagged on a branch that was split at a 90 degree right angle. From there we reached the river and the others started fishing but I fell off. I knew of reports out here and the legend of the Grassman. So as we were fishing I hear a snap from across the river then I see the thing stand up over 8-10 feet tall and growl before I saw a tree fall behind us. We booked it. We reached the truck and started going but the creature went in front of the gravel road looking at us as it walked and we had trees falling. So the next day we come back out to look for the creature and I hear a shot go off. So I move us back to the trail and get to the truck. I didn't have my phone but we found a weird intertwined tree things and rocks around it.

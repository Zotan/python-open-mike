I am curious how far back you keep records. I lived between Wintersville and Bloomingdale, Ohio, when I was growing up. One night when I was about 15 or 16 (around 1980 or 1981), I heard a cry and a loud sound by my bedroom window. I was terrified, so I went up to the old part of the house and got my dad. When he got his flashlight and went out to see what was happening, he saw a huge hairy thing on two feet running away. The next morning when we got up, we saw that our down spout had been twisted around and then folded in half. Now ordinarily I wouldn't have thought anything more than a prank, but the down spout was made out of steel. We have woods all around us where our house is. It is in the Broadacre/Reeds Mill area, off of Old Highway 22. I was wanting to know about the history of that specific area and also if there is any place where I can go to hear the sounds of Bigfoot. I know at one point, a few years ago, I read stories of the area and also heard the sounds. Any help that you can give me would be appreciated. I have been haunted all these years.

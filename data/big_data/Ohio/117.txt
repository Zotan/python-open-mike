6-10-08 I was walking with several other people in the Mogadore reservoir area. We were by the camp grounds that have been closed now for a few years. We heard running next to us on the other side of the tree line. It was like something large was crashing through the trees. As we approached another tree line and we were about to enter the woods we heard what sounded like someone throwing a HUGE rock through the trees. It landed a few feet away from us just inside the tree line. It was so large and hit so hard we felt the ground vibrate with the force. We all jumped sideways in fear of getting hit. We then heard a loud growl. Needless to say we were on our way OUT after that. I didnt believe in Bigfoot until tonite. I got on the net right when we got home to do some research. My mind keeps playing that growl OVER and OVER again.

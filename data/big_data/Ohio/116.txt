I listened to the alleged Bigfoot howling on the BFRO website and have came to a conclusion that I'm hearing almost exactly the same type of howling in the woods behind my northern Portage County Ohio home. The last time I heard this sound was two weeks ago and when I was out working in the backyard. We often hear it at dusk.

A large creature walking across the road. Color seemed to be medium to dark gray. We were about 200 yard from subject and thought at first it may have been a stranded motorist. Until we realized that we could see the top of the creature's head above a 8 foot tall road sign. We also found very large 3 toed tracks in the snow. The gate of the tracks seemed to be about 8 to 9 feet apart.

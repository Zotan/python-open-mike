I was squirrel hunting and walked right past bigfoot. That's what I'm calling it. I was about 3 miles in the woods and something took off running and out of the corner of my eye I saw a big brown thing"bigfoot" Well at first I thought it was a bear but a bear can't run on two feet, it can walk on two feet,but not run and this thing was running and had a stride. What gets me was the sound it had made as it was running, it kinda sounded like a monkey screaming. It made every hair on my body stand up ,even hairs I didn't know I had, I even cried. I will tell you this I was about 10 feet away and already walked right by it before it took off running. I have never in my life saw anything like it in the world.

I woke up on the morning of April 17, 2004, at about 5:45 AM and made my way out of the tent to make breakfast (I was on a camping trip with my father). As I got breakfast ready, I sat down to watch the water boil when I heard a loud scream/howl sounding very much like the Columbiana County, Ohio recordings on this website. As soon as I heard this I ran down a hill from my campsite to the North bank of Salt Fork Lake. On my way down I heard another howl. Both were slightly shorter than the Columbiana recordings but still the same sound. I know that they came from the southern bank and I would guess that they were most probably a mile or so away. I only heard the sound twice. I was still a little shocked and didn't tell my father until a few hours after he got up. The howls didn't wake up any campers that I know of. The two days before this incident I was walking on a trail and found a series of human-like footprints leading down the trail in the same direction I was traveling (west). I found one to still be in good condition so I cast it. It was of a left foot. It measured slightly over 12 inches long and was 5 1/2 inches wide.  It had three well defined toes, one that was barely pressed down, and one toe that is missing, although there is a space for a toe in the area in question. Other, less defined prints were found. They were in about 4 - 4 1/2 ft. strides.

I was woke up by pulling, yanking and scratching on our LOCKED shed doors. This creature was determined to get into the shed. I saw its hand  was in between the crack of the shed doors while its thumb was sticking out. I observed the creature to be about 4 to 5 feet tall. Muscle toned but not huge. Covered by hair and standing on two legs, not four. I observed this creature to look at me but over its shoulder.

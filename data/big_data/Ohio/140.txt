I was driving my step son to his soccer game on the weekend and I was already running late. We were driving over the bridge of the little Miami river and I saw this dark figure standing in the middle of the river. At first I thought it was a fly fisherman. I looked at the road then back at the river it was still there. I realized as I looked at it was too large to be a fisherman.  It had to have stood 8 to 9 feet tall.  It seemed to be facing away from me I didn't see face but I could see a head and arms but it really wasn't moving. It was brownish black. The river was low. I drove back to see if maybe it was a branch oddly positioned but when I went back it was gone.

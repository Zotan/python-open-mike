One night about 4 am I heard strange sounds. It started fairly distant and would repeat on a somewhat long interval. It slowly moved closer. As it closed in the sound went from slow intervals to rapidly repeating.  I estimated whatever it was moved 35-40 mph. It was about 50 yards from my house when I opened the door and fired 3 shotgun rounds in the general direction. The sounds sped off and I've never heard it again. I read one report that said that Preble County terrain was unsuitable for big foot. The person probably failed to consider the countless miles of tunnels in the area from the old limestone mines. I don't know how accessible they are from remote locations but certainly worth considering.

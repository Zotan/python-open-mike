During rabbit season in 1976 myself and four other went hunting just off Stanhope Kellogsville Road. It was one of the worst days to go hunting. It was snowing and unbelievably cold. We had been in the woods a couple of hours when I got seperated from the rest of the hunting party. The next thing I remember is a very loud sound like a freight train coming threw the woods. All I got was a five-second look at what ever it was it was. It was huge in size and running on two feet full steam ahead. There was no one else around. I do believe they were in front of me by a hundred yards. I told them about it when I caught up too them and they just laughed and said it was a deer. It was no deer and I have been hunting for 26 years. I have never been so scared in my life even though I stood there with a loaded shot gun.

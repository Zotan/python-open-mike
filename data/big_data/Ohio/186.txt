Two large white hairy creatures. The creatures where larger than man, both in build and height. The creatures were carrying a item which appeared to be the size of a pickup truck's bed. They were carrying the object over a hill towards a pond. When we stopped to observe, they dropped the item they were carrying and fell to the ground. The creatures tried to hide in the bush without success.

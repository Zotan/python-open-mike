Very early in the morning, 2:30am-3:30am, I was driving home and witnessed a large figure.  The large figure was standing behind the fence of The Ravenna Ammunition base.  I sighted this figure from my car.  As I turned from Rt 5 to Newton Falls Road, my headlights swept across the fence line, my eyes caught the figure.  The figure was slightly taller than the fence and broad bodied.  As I finished my turn I stopped, attempted to see the figure again without luck.

i went camping with a friend on labor day weekend in 1998.we were camping in wayne national forrest.on the third night of the camp out,i kept hearing twigs snapping out in the woods.i would shine my flash light out in the woods periodically.at 3:30 am i finally caught a bigfoot in light with it's back to me.it was about 50 feet out in the woods.it was about 7 foot tall.it had fur that was about 3 inches long.the collor was that of a cockerspaniel dog.an off collor of blond and brown.after a minute and a half,i thougt bigfoot would take off running because it was noticed by the light!but what it did next freaked me out,it crouched down and went to a deffensive mode.i then ran to get my gun.but when i arrived back to look for it it was gone.after the encounter i went out in the woods to look for foot prints  or evidence .but i did not find any.

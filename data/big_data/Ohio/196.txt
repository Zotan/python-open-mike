While traveling at 55-60 mph  I saw what appeared to be a tall being covered with brown hair. It was standing in a ditch beside a cement bridge that was about two to three feet above the road. The being's head was about another two to three feet above that. I estimated that the being would have stood eight to nine foot tall.

Was at a friend's, watching the house while they were on vacation.  Surrounding area is woods and fields for miles. Most houses are very far apart. Located south of Williamsburg, OH. On a trip from their separate garage to the house I heard two loud wood knocks coming from the woods behind their house. I immediately stopped and listened, and about 1 minute later heard a fairly close and very distinctive "whoop" come from that same area in the woods. I stayed out there for several more minutes, but didn't hear anything else. Later, in the middle of the night all of the dogs (all sleeping in various places in the house) all started barking loudly at the same time for several minutes. Of course, I have no idea what made made them do that and could have been many things. Only noted because it was the same night.

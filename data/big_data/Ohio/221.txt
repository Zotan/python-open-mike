It's back!  I spoke with you on the phone last fall after submitting my story.....well, they are back in the same location as of last night.  Just as last year rocks are being thrown, but with more aggression.  After leaving the area due to a large rock throwing encounter, I decided to return later....this time there was a vocalization! It was a roar or growl.  I then left and we did not return.  Please contact me and I will give you specific details.  Mxxxx, Barnesville, Ohio

It was on October 28th, a Saturday afternoon about 4:30pm. It was a clear sunny day when my wife and I were on our way down south driving on state route 19 South near Fremont, Ohio. As we came around a corner to a long straight away, we saw a tall brownish hairy creature walking from a field going east to west crossing the road. As I pointed it out to my wife we were probably about a quarter mile from it. As we watched while approaching it, its arms were long and swaying as it walked across the road in long strides. We watched it non-stop as we got closer to where it had just crossed the road. When we got to where it crossed the road, there was a guard rail and beyond the guard rail was a drastic slope into a heavily wooded area. We stopped and looked around but did not see anything around. It was hard to believe what we had seen, we were totally in awe and just could not explain nothing else to what it was except a BIGFOOT!

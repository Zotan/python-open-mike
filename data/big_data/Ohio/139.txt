It was several years ago, the date itself, I am not sure of. It was a dry summer, a very infamous drout if I remember. It wasn't uncommon for deer, raccoons, and other animals of the country side to wander in towards the edge of town to drink from the creek or reservoirs. This one particular day, my father and I awoke early in the morning to leave for Fremont, it was barely light out, still dark. Birds were chirping and singly beautifully as they do in the morning dawn, but then suddenly we heard itâ€¦ From what seemed to come from the creek and reservoirs area was an eerie cry that sounded like a sick cow. This cry so primal and terrifying it made the hair on the back of both of our necks stand strait up with fear. Instantly the birds were mostly quiet, their singing replaced by the sound of every dog with in a mile radius, barking wildly at the top of its lungs. My father, a veteran hunter of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio had never heard anything like this before in his life. We tried not to think about it and made sure all the doors on our house were locked before driving off to Fremont. Years later now, I am visiting your website and listening to sound clips of Bigfoot. And one made my heart stop, it was the exact same scream we heard so long ago.

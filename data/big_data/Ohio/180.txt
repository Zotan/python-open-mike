I was walking through a field while deer hunting and noticed odd tracks in the snow. I knelt down for a better look and noticed that the tracks had toes like humans do. I do not see a reason why a human would be walking through a field in deep snow barefoot. I have two photos of the tracks saved to my cell phone.

After getting online to your site we decided to go to a known sighting area as an afternoon excursion since the day was nice.  After walking up several steep inclines and falling often we came up to another ridge that was very difficult to climb for us. We spotted a foot print actually my boyfriend did. I knew he had found something when he called for me to come quick and climb up the last area. I climbed up and there it was a foot print.  I did not really believe in Bigfoot but now we are having second thoughts. Mind you we drove two hours one way, and walked for at least hour up hill off the trails.  We even went back the next day which was today 11/1/09 and made a cast of the print. Of course it was not as deep as yesterday but we still took the print and have pictures from yesterday on the cell phone.

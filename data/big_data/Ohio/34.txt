I know of a friend who saw a bigfoot behind Boston Mills Ski Resort in the Cuyahoga National Recration Area in 1990. He faced it and described it as the pictures others have scripted. I saw a bigfoot in 1995, in the evening, at around 9 p.m., running. It was at least 7 ft tall, hairy, and fast....in a weird way. I saw it running across route 82 in Sagamore Hills Ohio. It was running along the bike path which is located near a small Plaza with a Marcs located in it. It was dark, but I know it couldn't be human and it wasn't a bear, for it was more upright. It ran too fast and was too tall for it to be a man. It was hairy, but we were driving 45, so I can't get detailed. I think you should look into observing the CVNRA, especially behind Boston Mills Ski Resort. Start at Blue Hen Falls.
